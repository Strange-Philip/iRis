<p>
    OVERVIEW:
</p>
<p>
    The eyeball is protected by a bony socket called the orbit on the two sides
    of the nose. The seven bones that make up the orbit are FS MZPEL (frontal,
    sphenoid, Maxilla, Zygoma, Palatine, Ethmoid and Lacrimal). The four-sided
    orbital cavity is pyramidal in shape with an open base in front and an apex
    on the back. The four walls of the orbit converge posteriorly to reach the
    apex on their back formed by the optic foramen.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Base</u>
    : Opens out into the face, bounded by the orbital margins.
</p>
<p>
    Walls: roof, floor, and medial and lateral walls.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Apex:</u>
    Posterior, located at the opening of the optic canal, the optic foramen.
</p>
<p>
    <u>Entry Points:</u>
    the optic canal, superior orbital fissure, and the inferior orbital
    fissure.
</p>
<p>
    Sinuses: air-filled cavities in the bones; frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoid,
    and maxillary
</p>
<p>
    <u>BONES OF THE SKULL</u>
</p>
<p>
    The skull has 22 bones divided into cranial and facial bones. We start our
    discussion here because the bones of the orbit are made of 7 different
    bones from the cranium and the face. The bones of the skull protect the
    brain. There are 8 cranial bones and 14 facial bones.
</p>
<p>
    Cranial Bones: Frontal, Parietal (2), Temporal (2), Occipital, Sphenoid and
    Ethmoid
</p>
<p>
    The 14 facial bones are; Frontal bone, Maxilla, Mandible, Zygoma, Palatine
    bones, Lacrimal bones, nasal bones, vomer and inferior nasal conchae. Out
    of the skull bones, only mandible and auditory ossicles are movable.

</p>
<p>
    <u>BONES OF THE ORBIT</u>
</p>
<p>
    The orbits are two bony cavities on either side of the mid-sagittal plane
    below the anterior cranium that houses the eyeball. It houses other
    structures such as the extraocular muscles, nerves, lacrimal apparatus, fat
    and blood vessels. The bony orbit is shaped like a four-sided pyramid
    comprising of an apex and four walls.
</p>
<p>
    Three cranial bones form part of the orbit: the frontal, sphenoid, and the
    ethmoid bones. The rest are facial bones—maxillary, zygomatic, palatine,
    and lacrimal bones. The lacrimal bone is the smallest bone of the face and
    articulates with maxillary bone, ethmoid and frontal bones.
</p>
<p>
    1. Frontal bone
</p>
<p>
    2. Sphenoid
</p>
<p>
    3. Maxilla
</p>
<p>
    4. Zygoma
</p>
<p>
    5. Palatine
</p>
<p>
    6. Ethmoid
</p>
<p>
    7. Lacrimal
</p>
<p>
    <u>Mnemonic: FS MZPEL</u>
</p>
<p>
    Out of the 7 orbital bones, 3 are single; ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid
    (EFS). The rest are paired, 1 in each orbit.
</p>
<p>
    <u>BASE OF THE ORBIT</u>
</p>
<p>
    The base or front of the orbits is formed by 2 margins each. The
    supraorbital margin which is a thick ridge of the frontal bone and the
    inferior orbital margin. The inferior orbital margin is formed laterally by
    the zygomatic bone and medially by part of the maxilla. The cavity is often
    compared to the shape of a pear whose stalk is formed by the optic canal.
    Its medial walls are parallel to each other.
</p>
<p>
    <u> </u>
</p>
<p>
    <u>ORBITAL WALLS</u>
</p>
<p>
    The bony orbit is bounded by 4 walls; roof, floor, lateral and medial
    walls.
</p>
<p>
    The Orbital Roof
</p>
<p>
    The orbital roof is triangular and composed of;
</p>
<p>
    1. Orbital plate of the frontal bone. (anterior)
</p>
<p>
    2. Lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. (posterior)
</p>
<p>
    Mnemonic: rooFLeS.
</p>
<p>
    • Frontal bone forms the ridge of the superior orbital margin.
</p>
<p>
    • Cartilaginous u-shape structure called trochlear attached to the frontal
    plate.
</p>
<p>
    • Tendon of the superior oblique muscle passes through the trochlear at its
    inflection.

    CLINICAL NOTES: Refer to Orbital Rim Fracture in the clinical notes.
</p>
<p>
    The Orbital Floor
</p>
<p>
    The orbital floor is also triangular and made up of:
</p>
<p>
    1. Orbital plate of maxillary bone
</p>
<p>
    2. Orbital plate of zygomatic bone
</p>
<p>
    3. Small orbital process of the palatine bone.
</p>
<p>
    Mnemonic: ZYGMAP.
</p>
<p>
    • Maxillary bone makes up most of the floor with largest part of the rest
    made of the zygoma.
</p>
<p>
    • Floor is separated from the lateral wall by the inferior orbital fissure.
</p>
<p>
    • The floor is the shortest of the walls.

</p>
<p>
    CLINICAL NOTES: Refer to Blow Out Fracture in the clinical notes.
</p>
<p>
    The Medial Wall
</p>
<p>
    The medial wall is rectangular and formed by:
</p>
<p>
    1. Frontal process of the maxilla
</p>
<p>
    2. The lacrimal bone
</p>
<p>
    3. Orbital plate of the ethmoid
</p>
<p>
    4. A part of the body of the sphenoid.
</p>
<p>
    · The ethmoid bone forms most of the medial wall.
</p>
<p>
    • The orbital plate of the ethmoid is sometimes said to be “paper thin”
    (lamina papyracea)
</p>
<p>
    • The medial wall is the thinnest of the orbital walls but the least prone
    to fracture due to support of the honeycombed structure of the ethmoid bone
</p>
<p>
    • The lacrimal sac lies in the lacrimal fossa
</p>
<p>
    • The thickness of the fossa allows easy penetration of needle during
    dacryocystorhinostomy
</p>
<p>
    • The anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals are located within the
    frontoethmoidal suture.
</p>
<p>
    The Lateral Wall
</p>
<p>
    Roughly triangular composed of:
</p>
<p>
    1. Zygomatic bone anteriorly
</p>
<p>
    2. Greater wing of the sphenoid posteriorly
</p>
<p>
    3. The zygoma separates the orbit from the temporal fossa.
</p>
<p>
    • One or more foramina may be present, serving as a conduit for nerves and
    blood vessels between face and orbit.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    · The lateral wall is directed posteriorly and allows for a wide field of
    view but makes the eye prone to injury.
</p>
<p>
    · The zygomaticosphenoidal suture is the thinnest portion of the lateral
    wall and a good point of entry during lateral orbitotomy
</p>
<p>
    · The lateral (marginal) orbital tubercle is a small bony prominence
    located on the orbital surface of zygoma. It is the attachment for
</p>
<p>
    o the aponeurosis of the levator palpebrae superioris
</p>
<p>
    o lateral palpebral ligament
</p>
<p>
    o lateral check ligament.
</p>
<p>
    · Greater wing of the sphenoid separates the orbit from the middle cranial
    fossa.
</p>
<p>
    · The roof is separated from the lateral wall in back by the superior
    orbital fissure and in front by the frontozygomatic and frontosphenoidal
    sutures.
</p>
<p>
    · The inferior orbital fissure separates the posterior part of the floor
    from the lateral wall.
</p>
<p>
    CLINICAL NOTES: Refer to ZMC in the clinical notes section.
</p>
<p>
    <u>WEAK SPOTS IN THE ORBIT</u>
</p>
<p>
    The infraorbital groove and canal constitute weak spots in the floor of the
    orbit. Another weak spot, as shown in is the thin bone ethmoid, which
    separates the eye from the medial wall. Ethmoiditis in children may give
    rise to orbital cellulitis, and severe contusion injuries can cause rupture
    of the medial wall and periorbital crepitus.
</p>
<p>
    The lacrimal fossa in the medial wall is also a weak spot. The fossa lies
    between the anterior and posterior lacrimal crests and lodges the lacrimal
    sac, which is continuous below with the nasolacrimal duct. The duct’s lower
    end opens into the inferior meatus of the nose for drainage of tears when
    severe emotional stress occurs.

</p>
<p>
    <u> </u>
</p>
<p>
    <u>ORBITAL MARGINS</u>
</p>
<p>
    Although dimensions of the orbit vary widely, the average horizontal
    diameter of the orbital margin is 4 cm, the average vertical diameter is
    3.5 cm, and the average depth is 4.5 cm. The frontal bone forms the
    superior orbital margin. The highest point of this arch is supraorbital
    notch. and is the conduit for the supraorbital vessels and nerves.
</p>
<p>
    The lateral orbital margin is the orbital region most exposed to possible
    injury and therefore is the strongest area of the orbital margin. It is
    formed by the zygomatic process of the frontal bone superiorly and by the
    frontal process of the zygomatic bone inferiorly.

</p>
<p>
    <u>ORBITAL APEX</u>
</p>
<p>
    It is the entry site of all the nerves &amp; blood vessels to the eye and
    all the extraocular muscles except the inferior oblique. This lies near the
    medial end of the superior orbital fissure and contains the optic canal.
    The superior and inferior orbital fissures and the optic canal open into
    the orbit. They transmit important nerves and vessels.

</p>
<p>
    <u>PATHWAYS INTO THE ORBIT</u>
</p>
<p>
    There are three main pathways by which structures enter or leave the
    orbit—the optic canal, superior and inferior orbital fissure.
</p>
<p>
    The Optic Canal
</p>
<p>
    The optic canal conveys the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery from the
    optic canal into the orbit. The canal is housed in the lesser wing of the
    sphenoid bone with a contribution from the inferomedial optic strut. It
    runs 8–10 mm in length and is 5–6 mm in diameter. The optic canal and
    foramen attain adult dimensions by 3 years and are symmetric in most
    persons. A canal/foramen that is larger in diameter by at least 1 mm than
    the contralateral side may be considered abnormal.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Superior Orbital Fissure
</p>
<p>
    This is the gap between the lesser wing and the greater wing of the
    sphenoid. It is located between the roof and the lateral wall. It connects
    the middle cranial cavity with the orbit. A circular band of connective
    tissue, the common tendinous ring or ANNULUS OF ZINN is located anterior to
    the fissure and optic canal. The ring is the origin of the four rectus
    muscles.

</p>
<p>
    It is bounded above by the greater wing of the sphenoid, below by the
    maxilla, the palatine and laterally by the zygoma. The fissure connects the
    orbit with the pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossa.
