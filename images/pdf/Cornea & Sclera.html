<p>
    · The anterior surface of the cornea is covered by the tear film, and the
    posterior surface borders the aqueous-filled anterior chamber.

    § The outermost layer of stratified corneal epithelium.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · It is five to seven cells thick and measures approximately 50 μm.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · The epithelium thickens in the periphery and is continuous with the
    conjunctival epithelium at the limbus.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · The surface layer of corneal epithelium is two cells thick and displays a
    very smooth anterior surface.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It consists of <em>nonkeratinized </em>squamous cells, each of which
        contains a flattened nucleus and fewer cellular organelles than deeper
        cells.
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Cell size varies but a superficial cell can be 50 μm in diameter and 5 μm
    in height.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · The plasma membrane of the surface epithelial cells secretes a <strong>glycocalyx </strong>component that adjoins
    the mucin layer of the

<p>
    · It enhances tear film stability
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü As many projections (microplicae; the fingerlike projection and
    microvilli; the ridiglike projection) located on the apical surfaces of
    outermost cell increase surface area, thus enhance tear film stability.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Prevent uptake of excess fluid from the tears (Figure 5)
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü Tight junctions (zonula occludens) join the surface cells along the
    lateral wall near the apical surfaces. These junctures provide a barrier to
    intercellular movement of substances from the tear layer and prevent the
    <br />
    uptake of excess fluid from the tear film.

</ul>
<p>
    ü Maintenance of a smooth corneal surface depends on replacement of surface
    cells.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü Cell proliferation occurs in the basal layer,
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü Only cells in contact with basement membrane have the ability to divide
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü Stem cells located in a 0.5-1mm wide band around the corneal periphery
    are responsible for renewal of the basal cell layer
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü A slow migration of cells occurs from the periphery to the centre of the
    cornea
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü Turn over time for the entire epithelium is 7 days. However, if the
    basement membrane is damaged, complete healing takes several months.

    ü Is made up of two to three layers of <strong>wing cells. </strong>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü These cells have wing like lateral processes, are polyhedral, and
    <br />
    have convex anterior surfaces and concave posterior surfaces that fit over
    the basal cells.

</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü The diameter of a wing cell is approximately 20 μm.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü Desmosomes and gap junctions join wing cells to each other, and
    desmosomes join wing cells to surface and basal cells.

</p>
<p>
    § The <strong>innermost</strong> <strong>basal cell layer </strong>of the
    corneal epithelium
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü Is a single layer of columnar cells, with diameters ranging from 8 to 10
    μm.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü These cells contain oval-shaped nuclei displaced toward the apex and
    <br />
    oriented at right angles to the surface.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü The rounded, apical surface of each cell lies adjacent to the wing cells,
    <br />
    and the basal surface attaches to the underlying basement membrane (basal
    lamina).
<p>
</p>
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Descemet’s membrane is considered the basement membrane of the endothelium.
    It is produced continually and therefore thickens throughout life, such
    that it has doubled by age 40 years. In children it is 5μm thick and will
    increase to approximately 15μm over a lifetime.

</p>
<p>
    · Descemet’s membrane consists of two laminae:
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The anterior lamina: it is approximately 3μm thick, exhibits a banded
    appearance and is a latticework of collagen fibrils secreted during
    embryonic development.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The posterior<em> </em>lamina: it<em> </em>is non-banded and homogeneous;
    it is the portion secreted by the endothelium throughout life.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The collagen fibrils are arranged such that Descemet's membrane exhibits
    an elastic property

</p>
<p>
    Ø The cornea has two primary functions:
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü to refract light
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    ü to transmit light: The cornea transmits 99% of incident light this is due
    to its high level of transparency
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    · Factors that affect the amount of Corneal Refraction
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The curvature of the anterior corneal surface
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The change in refractive index from air to cornea (actually the tear
    film)
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø Corneal thickness
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The curvature of the posterior corneal surface
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The change in refractive index from cornea
    <br />
    to aqueous humor.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · The total refractive power of the eye focused at infinity is between 60
    and 65 diopters (D), with 43 to 48 D attributable to the cornea.

    of Light
    <em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The cornea transmits light with wavelengths between
    <br />
    310 and 2500 nm.
    <em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Ø Wave lengths below 300 nm are absorbed by the epithelium and Bowman’s
    layer and do not penetrate deeper; those between 300 to 320 nm are absorbed
    by corneal stroma.
    <em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The ability of the cornea to absorb the shorter wavelengths of
    ultraviolet radiation is <em>protective </em>to deeper structures (lens and
    retina), but the cornea is vulnerable to damage from this constant
    exposure.
    <em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Ø UVR induces oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS).
    <em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Ø These free radicals are highly reactive because of an unpaired electron
    and can damage cellular structures.
    <em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Ø The corneal epithelium has some protection against the damage caused by
    UVR absorption.
    <em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>

    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Ø Ascorbate can absorb UVR, and is also a cellular antioxidant that can
    reduce free radicals and neutralize their activity.
    <em>

<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø Regular arrangement of collagen fibrils in the stroma
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø Collagen fibrils are ineffective at scattering light (Spaces between
    collagen fibres is less than the wavelength of light)
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø Avascular: The cornea is avascular and obtains its nourishment by
    diffusion from the aqueous humor and from the conjunctival and episcleral
    capillary networks located in the limbus.

<p>
</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em> </em>
        Internally at this juncture, there is a larger furrow, the <em>internal scleral sulcus, </em>which has a
        scooped-out appearance
        and contains the trabecular meshwork and
        <br />
        the canal of Schlemm, the major route for drainage of the aqueous
        humor.
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Histologically, the <em>anterior boundary </em>of the limbus consists

        THE SCLERA
        <p>
        </p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        An Overview of the Sclera
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>sclera </strong>forms the posterior five-sixths of the
    connective tissue coat of the globe. The sclera maintains the shape of the
    globe, offering resistance to internal and external forces, and provides an
    attachment for the extraocular muscle insertions. The thickness of the
    sclera varies from 1 mm at the posterior pole to 0.3 mm just behind the
    rectus muscle insertions.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>
        Layers of the Sclera
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    · There are basically two layers of the sclera. They are;
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø Sclera propa: is the innermost aspect of the sclera merges with the
    choroidal tissue in the suprachoroid layer and it is avascular.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Ø Episclera: is a loose, vascularised, connective tissue that lies just
    outer to the sclera. The larger episcleral blood vessels are visible
    through the conjunctiva. The episclera is joined to the Tenon’s capsule by
    strands of connective tissue and progressively becomes thinner towards the
    back of the eye.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · The sclera itself is continuous with the corneal stroma at the limbus.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · The diameter of collagen fibrils varies from 25 to 230nm.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · The fibrils are arranged in irregular bundles that branch and interlace.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Bundle widths and thickness vary
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · External bundles are narrower and thinner than deeper bundles.

    <strong>
        SCLERA
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Orientation of bundles in sclera is very irregular compared to that in
    the cornea.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Bundles in outer regions run approximately parallel to the surface with
    interweaving between the bundles
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · In inner regions bundles run in all directions.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · This random arrangement and the vast amount of interweaving may give
    strength and flexibility to the eyeball.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Elastic fibers are sometimes found in the sclera between and sometimes
    within bundles.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Fibroblasts are also present though less numerous than in the cornea
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Stromal ground substance is similar to corneal ground substance but with
    fewer glycosaminoglycan (GAG’s).
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Innermost aspect of the sclera merges with the choroid in the
    suprachoroid layer.

        The Scleral Spur
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>scleral spur </strong>is a region of circularly oriented
    collagen bundles that extends from the inner aspect of the sclera. In its
    entirety, the scleral spur is actually a ring, although on cross section it
    appears wedge shaped, resembling a spur.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    At the spur’s posterior edge, its fibers blend with the more obliquely
    arranged scleral fibers. The posterior scleral spur is the origin of the
    longitudinal ciliary muscle fibers and most of the trabecular meshwork
    sheets attach to its anterior aspect, such that the collagen of the spur is
    continuous with that of the trabeculae

</ul>
<p>
    Ø Number of GAG’s

    Ø Size and distribution of collagen fibrils.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Sclera contain ¼ the amount of GAG’s found in the cornea.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · Hence the sclera is less hydrated than the cornea (68%)
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    · The greater variation in fibril size and irregular spacing between the
    components induce light scattering
<p>
</p>

<p>
    · This renders the sclera opaque.

        Scleral Color

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The anterior sclera is visible through the conjunctiva and, if healthy, is
    white but may appear colored as a result of age or disease. In the newborn,
    the sclera has a bluish tint because it is almost transparent and the
    underlying vascular uvea shows through. The sclera also may appear blue in
    connective tissue diseases that cause scleral thinning. The sclera might
    appear yellow in the presence of fatty deposits, which can occur with age.
    Likewise, the sclera may appear yellow
    <br />
    in liver disease because of the buildup of metabolic wastes.

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The sclera contains a number of foramina and canals. The <em>anterior scleral foramen </em>is the area occupied by
    the cornea. The
    optic nerve passes through the <em>posterior scleral foramen, </em>which is
    bridged by a network of scleral tissue called the <strong>lamina cribrosa. </strong>It is similar to a sieve, with
    interwoven
    collagen fibrils forming canals through which the optic nerve bundles pass.
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    The lamina cribrosa is the weakest area of the outer connective tissue
    tunic. The canals that pass through the sclera carry nerves and vessels,
    and are possible routes by which disease can exit or enter the eye. The
    canals are designated by their location.

    The <em>posterior apertures </em>are located around the posterior scleral
    foramen and are the passages for the posterior ciliary arteries and nerves.
    The <em>middle apertures </em>lie approximately 4 mm posterior to the
    equator and carry the vortex veins. The <em>anterior apertures </em>are
    near the limbus at the muscle insertions and are the passages for the
    anterior ciliary vessels, which are branches from the muscular arteries.

    <strong>Scleral Blood Supply</strong>
<p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Because it is relatively inactive metabolically, the sclera has a minimal
    blood supply. A number of vessels pass through the sclera to other tissues,
    but the sclera is considered avascular because it contains no capillary
    beds. Nourishment is furnished by small branches from the episcleral and
    choroidal vessels, and branches of the long posterior ciliary arteries.

    <strong>
        Scleral Innervation
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Sensory innervation is supplied to the posterior sclera by branches of the
    short ciliary nerves; the remainder of the sclera is served by branches of
    the long ciliary nerves.
