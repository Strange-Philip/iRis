    WHAT IS VITREOUS HUMOUR?
</p>
<p>
    Vitreous is a transparent colorless, gel-like acellular connective tissue
    that occupies the posterior compartment of the eye. The word,” vitreous” is
    derived from a Latin word, “vitrum” which means glass. This is because the
    vitreous has a glass-like appearance.

<p>
    VOLUME: It makes up 80% of the volume of the eye. IE, the largest structure
    of the eye.

    REFRACTIVE INDEX: 1.336

<p>
    <strong>COMPOSITION OF VITREOUS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. Vitreous is composed of about 99% water.
</p>
<p>
    B. Remaining 1% is made up of:
</p>
<p>
    1. Collagen fibrils. ( Type II collagen is the most abundant, about 90% and
    the remaining being type IX)
</p>
<p>
    -Helps for vitreous attachments
</p>
<p>
    2. Hyaluronic acid.
</p>
<p>
    - Maintains the vitreous structure. IE, the jelly-like nature of the
    vitreous.
</p>
<p>
    3. Salts
</p>
<p>
    4. Soluble protein
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NOTE</strong>
    : Irrespective of its high water composition (99%), it is describe as
    gel-like because of the presence of type II collagen. The breakdown of type
    II collagen as a result of old age leads to loss of its gel-like nature.
</p>
<p>
    In humans, vitreous humour begins as fluid (20%) and gel (80%). Gradually
    changes to fluid (60%) and gel (40%).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>DEVELOPMENT OF VITREOUS </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The development of vitreous is divided into 3 stages. They are:
</p>
<p>
    A. Primary vitreous
</p>
<p>
    B. Secondary vitreous
</p>
<p>
    C. Tertiary vitreous

        alt="image" />
</p>
<p>
    A. PRIMARY VITREOUS
</p>
<p>
    i. Develops at the end of 3<sup>rd</sup> embryonic week
</p>
<p>
    ii. Contains primary hyaloid vessels. These are equivalent to blood
    vessels.
</p>
<p>
    iii. The hyaloid vessels dissolves before birth.
</p>
<p>
    iv. After the hyaloid vessels have dissolved, the passage way through which
    they travelled remains as a canal known as the, “cloquent’s canal” or
    “hyaloid canal”
</p>
<p>
    B. SECONDARY VITREOUS
</p>
<p>
    i. Starts to develop by the 9<sup>th</sup> week.
</p>
<p>
    ii. This becomes the mature vitreous. IE, secondary vitreous eventually
    fills the globe and encircles and dissolves the primary vitreous.
</p>
<p>
    iii. It is mostly acellular and fibrous.
</p>
<p>
    C. TERTIARY VITREOUS
</p>
<p>
    i. Begins to develop at 6month of embryonic stage
</p>
<p>
    ii. It is the condensed fibrous structure of the secondary vitreous. This
    eventually forms the zonules.
</p>
<p>
    iii. The zonules merge with the lens capsule and the ciliary body.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>VITREOUS ATTACHMENTS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Vitreous forms several attachments with the surrounding structures by the
    aid of the collagen fibrils.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Below are some vitreous attachments arranged in decreasing order of
    strengths:
</p>
<p>
    1. The strongest attachment is the vitreous base – at ora serrata (NB- Ora
    serrata is the place where retina terminates)
</p>
<p>
    2. Attachment at the posterior lens
</p>
<p>
    - This attachment is made possible by the hyaloideoscapsular ligament (of
    Weiger) or retrolental ligament.
</p>
<p>
    - Also, the retrolental space (of Berger) is a potential space found within
    the ring formed by the retrolental ligament. This potential space is
    present because the lens and vitreous are juxtaposed.
</p>
<p>
    3. Attachment with optic disc
</p>
<p>
    4. Attachment with macula
</p>
<p>
    5. The weakest attachment is with the blood vessels.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>FUNCTIONS OF THE VITREOUS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Serves as a storage area – for metabolites for the retina and lens
</p>
<p>
    2. Protection – because of its viscoelastic properties, it act as a shock
    absorber protecting the fragile retinal tissue during rapid eye movements
    and strenuous physical activity
</p>
<p>
    3. Provides a clear medium for light transmission.
</p>
<p>
    QUESTION
</p>
<p>
    Why was it imperative for hyaloid vessels to dissolve?
</p>
<p>
    ANSWER
</p>
<p>
    To enhance the transparency property of vitreous.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. VITREOUS HAEMORRHAGE
</p>
<p>
    - This condition occurs when some retinal blood vessels rupture and bleed
    into the vitreous humour. The presence of blood reduces the transparency of
    the vitreous and can serve as an obstacle to light focusing on the retinal.
</p>
<p>
    2. POSTERIOR VITREAL DETACHMENT(PVD)
</p>
<p>
    PVD is a natural change that occurs during adulthood, when the vitreous
    separates from the retina.
</p>
<p>
    3. PERIPHERAL RETINAL FRACTION
</p>
<p>
    With aging, the vitreous base adhesion extend further posteriorly, and the
    border approaches the equator. These changes can increase traction on the
    peripheral retina and might contribute to retinal tears and detachment.
</p>
<p>
    4. FLOATERS
</p>
<p>
    A disruption in the HA-collagen complex causes collagen fibrils to
    aggregate to bundles which may become large enough to be visible.
