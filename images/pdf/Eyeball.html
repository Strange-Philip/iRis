    OVERVIEW
</p>
<p>
    The eyeball is a bilateral and spherical organ, which houses the structures
    responsible for vision. It lies in a bony cavity within the facial skeleton
    – known as the <strong>bony orbit</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    There are;
</p>
<p>
    · 3 layers: fibrous, vascular and inner
</p>
<p>
    · 3 chambers: anterior, posterior and vitreous
</p>
<p>
    · 2 segments: anterior and posterior—separated by the lens.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Eyebrows</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The eyebrows are formed by several rows of hair. They separate the upper
    lid from the forehead. Besides protection, they contribute to facial
    expression by their movement.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Eye lashes</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Eye lashes arise from follicles arranged in irregular rows. There are 5-6
    rows in the upper lid and 3-4 rows in the lower lid.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Canthi</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The site of the union of the upper and lower eyelids near the nose is known
    as medial canthus and the site of union towards the ear is known as lateral
    canthus.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Caruncle</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is a fleshy elevation situated close to the medial canthus. It has
    hair and sebaceous glands. It functions to trap foreign bodies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Plica semilunaris</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is a half-moon shaped movable fold of bulbar conjunctiva.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Palpebral fissure</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is the space between the eyelids. It is usually around 8-11mm in
    height.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Eyelids (palpebrae)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The eyelids are specialized, movable skin folds. The eyelid is composed of
    two parts- anterior lamina with skin and muscle (orbicularis) and the
    posterior
</p>
<p>
    lamina with tarsus and conjunctiva.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Skin of the lid</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The skin of the lid is extremely thin and elastic. It is loosely attached.
    At the base, or lid margin, lashes or cilia are present. The base of each
    cilia has sweat glands known as glands of Moll and sebaceous glands known
    as glands of Zeis. The suppurative
</p>
<p>
    inflammation of these glands results in styes (hordeolum).
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Muscles of the eyelid</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are two types of muscles in the lid- the retractors (which open the
    lid) and the protractors (which close the lid). The main retractor of the
    lid is the <strong>levator<em> </em>palpebrae superiors</strong>. It
    originates near the apex of the<em> </em>orbit and is inserted anteriorly
    into the skin of the<em> </em>upper lid forming the lid crease. This muscle
    is<em> </em>supplied by the 3rd cranial nerve.<em></em>
</p>
<p>
    The protractor of the eyelid is the <strong>orbicularis oculi</strong>.
    This muscle is situated beneath the skin of the eyelid. This is supplied by
    the 7th cranial nerve. Orbicularis oculi muscle helps in blinking.
</p>
<p>
    Normally the upper eyelid covers the upper 2mm of the limbus. Malposition
    of upper lid downwards is known as ptosis. As we close our eyes, the eyes
    move up. This reflex is known as Bell’s phenomenon.

<p>
    Layers of the Eyeball
</p>
<p>
    The eyeball is formed by three layers –
</p>
<p>
    1. Fibrous (Cornea and Sclera)
</p>
<p>
    2. Vascular (uvea)
</p>
<p>
    3. Inner (retina)
</p>
<p>
    Each of these layers has a specialised structure and function.
</p>
<p>
    1. Fibrous
</p>
<p>
    The fibrous layer of the eye is the outermost layer. It consists of the
    sclera and cornea, which are continuous with each other. Their main
    functions are to provide shape to the eye and support the deeper
    structures.
</p>
<p>
    The sclera comprises the majority of the fibrous layer (approximately 85%).
    It provides attachment to the extraocular muscles – these muscles are
    responsible for the movement of the eye. It is visible as the white part of
    the eye.
</p>
<p>
    The cornea is transparent and positioned centrally at the front of the eye.
    Light entering the eye is refracted by the cornea.
</p>
<p>
    2. Vascular
</p>
<p>
    The vascular layer of the eye lies underneath the fibrous layer. It
    consists of the choroid, ciliary body and iris:
</p>
<p>
    Choroid – layer of connective tissue and blood vessels. It provides
    nourishment to the outer layers of the retina.
</p>
<p>
    Ciliary body – comprised of two parts – the ciliary muscle and ciliary
    processes. The ciliary muscle consists of a collection of smooth muscles
    fibres. These are attached to the lens of the eye by the ciliary processes.
    The ciliary body controls the shape of the lens, and contributes to the
    formation of aqueous humor
</p>
<p>
    Iris – circular structure, with an aperture in the centre (the pupil). The
    diameter of the pupil is altered by smooth muscle fibres within the iris,
    which are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. It is situated
    between the lens and the cornea.
</p>
<p>
    3. Inner
</p>
<p>
    The inner layer of the eye is formed by the retina; its light detecting
    component. The retina is composed of two layers: pigmented and neural
    layers.
</p>
<p>
    Pigmented (outer) layer – formed by a single layer of cells. It is attached
    to the choroid and supports the choroid in absorbing light (preventing
    scattering of light within the eyeball). It continues around the whole
    inner surface of the eye.
</p>
<p>
    Neural (inner) layer – consists of photoreceptors, the light detecting
    cells of the retina. It is located posteriorly and laterally in the eye.
</p>
<p>
    Anteriorly, the pigmented layer continues but the neural layer does not –
    this is part is known as the non-visual retina. Posteriorly and laterally,
    both layers of the retina are present. This is the optic part of the
    retina.
</p>
<p>
    The optic part of the retina can be viewed during ophthalmoscopy. The
centre of the retina is marked by an area known as the    <strong>macula</strong>. It is yellowish in colour, and highly pigmented.
The macula contains a depression called the    <strong>fovea centralis</strong>, which has a high concentration of light
    detecting cells. It is the area responsible for high acuity vision. The
    area that the optic nerve enters the retina is known as the optic disc – it
    contains no light detecting cells.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Anterior and Posterior Chambers</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are two fluid filled areas in the eye – known as the anterior and
    posterior chambers. The anterior chamber is located between the cornea and
    the iris, and the posterior chamber between the iris and ciliary processes.
</p>
<p>
    The chambers are filled with aqueous humor – a clear plasma-like fluid that
    nourishes and protects the eye. The aqueous humor is produced constantly,
    and drains via the trabecular meshwork, an area of tissue at the base of
    the cornea, near the anterior chamber.
</p>
<p>
    If the drainage of aqueous humor is obstructed, a condition known as
    glaucoma can result.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Lens</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The lens of the eye is located anteriorly, between the vitreous humor and
    the pupil. The shape of the lens is altered by the ciliary body, altering
    its refractive power. In old age, the lens can become opaque – a condition
    known as a cataract.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Vitreous Body</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The vitreous body is a transparent gel which fills the posterior segment of
    the eyeball (the area posterior to the lens).
</p>
<p>
    It is marked by a narrow canal which runs from the optic disc to the lens –
    the hyaloid canal. This is a fetal remnant.
</p>
<p>
    The vitreous body has three main functions:
</p>
<p>
    · Contributes to the magnifying power of the eye
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Supports the lens
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Holds the layers of the retina in place
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Vasculature</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The eyeball receives arterial blood primarily via the ophthalmic artery.
    This is a branch of the internal carotid artery, arising immediately distal
    to the cavernous sinus. The ophthalmic artery gives rise to many branches,
    which supply different components of the eye. The central artery of the
    retina is the most important branch – supplying the internal surface of the
    retina. Occlusion of this artery will quickly result in blindness.

    />
</p>
<p>
    Venous drainage of the eyeball is carried out by the superior and inferior
    ophthalmic veins. These drain into the cavernous sinus, a dural venous
    sinus in close proximity to the eye.
