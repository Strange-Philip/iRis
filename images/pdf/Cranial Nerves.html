    Cranial nerves are involved in head and neck function, and processes such
    as eating, speech, vision and facial expression. There are 12 pairs of
    cranial nerves that arise directly from the brain.
</p>
<p>
    They pass through or into the cranial bones (thus cranial nerves) and are
    numbered I to XII roughly in order from top (rostral) to bottom (caudal).
    The first two nerves (olfactory and optic) arise from the cerebrum, whereas
    the remaining ten emerge from the brain stem.

    Simplistically, each cranial nerve can be described as being sensory, motor
    or both. We are looking at the overview of cranial nerves because half of
    the cranial nerves (from 2 to 7) are involved in sight.
</p>
<p>
    The names of the cranial nerves relate to their function and they are also
    numerically identified in roman numerals (I-XII). They are

    <strong><u>Difference between Cranial and Spinal Nerves</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Cranial nerves and spinal nerves are two types of nerves of the peripheral
    nervous system. The key difference between cranial and spinal nerves is
    that the cranial nerves come from the brain while the spinal nerves come
    from the spinal cord. Another difference between cranial and spinal nerves
    is that there are 12 cranial nerve pairs while there are 31 spinal nerve
    pairs in mammals. In addition, we can also identify a difference between
    cranial and spinal nerves based on their functions. That is, the cranial
    nerves coordinate the activities associated with the head and neck whereas,
    the spinal nerves coordinate the activities associated with all the body
    parts, below the neck. The two nerves also differ in the way of numbering
    and naming.

    NB: The largest of the cranial nerves is the trigeminal nerve, which is the
    cranial nerve 5. It has three divisions containing both sensory and motor
    nerves. The trochlear nerve is the smallest of the cranial nerves. It is
    the fourth cranial nerve (CN IV) and one of the ocular motor nerves that
    controls eye movement.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>CRANIAL NERVES INVOLVED IN VISION</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The orbital structures are innervated by cranial nerves (CNs) II, III, IV,
    V, VI, and VII. Motor functions of the striated muscles are controlled by
    CN III, the oculomotor nerve; CN IV, the trochlear nerve; CN VI, the
    abducens nerve; and CN VII, the facial nerve. CN V, the trigeminal nerve,
    carries the sensory supply from the orbital structures. CN II, the optic
    nerve, carries visual information.
</p>
<p>
    NB: The trigeminal nerve is the main sensory nerve involved in vision. Its
    3 divisions also have sub-divisions.
</p>
<p>
    The majority of the nerves directed to the eye are composed by thin,
    unmyelinated nerve fibers often incompletely surrounded by Schwann cells,
    while less than 30 percent present a myelin sheath. The absence of myelin
    sheath increases transparency especially in refracting surfaces.
</p>
<p>
    The sensory innervation of the eye is provided by the peripheral axons of
    primary sensory neurons located in the trigeminal ganglion. The sensory
    nerves enter the eyeball mainly through the ciliary nerves and reach all
    ocular tissues with the exception of the lens and the retina.
</p>
<p>

        alt="Image" />

</p>
<p>
    Ocular innervation is particularly rich in the cornea but all tissues of
    the anterior segment of the eye have an abundant sensory supply.
</p>
<p>
    Ocular sensory fibers are functionally heterogeneous and include
    mechanoreceptor, polymodal nociceptor, and cold receptor types of sensory
    units.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, the nerves respond to a variety of physical and chemical
    stimuli. Impulse activity originated at peripheral sensory nerve fibers of
    the eye reaches second-order neurons located at the trigeminal nucleus
    caudalis in the lower brainstem. Sensory information travels subsequently
    to relay stations in the contralateral posterior thalamic nucleus and
    finally reaches the cortex.
