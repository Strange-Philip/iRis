    THE TEAR FILM
</p>
<p>
    OVERVIEW
</p>
<p>
    The tear film overlays the ocular surface, which is comprised of the
    corneal and conjunctival epithelia, and provides the interface between
    these epithelia and the external environment. The tear film is essential
    for the health and protection of the ocular surface and for clear vision as
    the tear film is the first refractive surface of the eye.
</p>
<p>
    The tear film has a thickness of 7 to 10µm, with the aqueous layer
    accounting for 90% of the thickness. volume of 7.4 µl in
    <br />
    unanaesthesized eye, 2.6 µl in anaesthesized eye and decreases with age.
    <br />
    It is grossly visible at the lower lid margin and is optically clear and is
    continuosly renewed.It is composed of proteins &amp; mucoproteins to
    maintain its wetting and viscosity necessary for health of the epithelium
    of the ocular surface.
</p>
<p>
    FUNCTIONS OF THE TEAR FILM
</p>
<p>
    1. Keeps the surface moist and serves as a lubricant between the globe and
    eyelids
</p>
<p>
    2. Traps debris and helps remove sloughed epithelial cells and debris
</p>
<p>
    3. Is the primary source of atmospheric oxygen for the cornea
</p>
<p>
    4. Provides a smooth refractive surface necessary for optimum optical
    function
</p>
<p>
    5. contains antibacterial substances (lysozyme, beta-lysin,lactoferrin,
    immunoglobulins) to help protect against infection
</p>
<p>
    6. helps to maintain corneal hydration by changes in tonicity that occur
    with evaporation
</p>
<p>
    7. contains various growth factors and peptides that
    can regulate ocular surface wound repair.
</p>
<p>
    GROUPS OF TEAR FILM
</p>
<p>
    • The tear film can be grouped into;
</p>
<p>
    Ø The tear mensicus
</p>
<p>
    Ø The precorneal tearfilm
</p>
<p>
    Ø The conjuctival sac( between the bulbar and palpebrae)
</p>
<p>
    1. The precorneal tear film is 3.4micrometers thick ,7.4 microliters in
    volume and 2.6 microliters when anaesthesized.It was known to be composed
    of three layers;
</p>
<p>
    a. The mucin layer;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Deepest layer,0.02-0.05µm thick
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Secreted by conjunctival globlet cells,Crypts of Henle,gland of Manz and
    also by main Lacrimal gland.
</p>
<p>
    · Made of glycoprotein,mixed with lipids,anchored by microvilli
</p>
<p>
    · Conjunctival and corneal epithelia express transmembrane mucins 1, 2, and
    4, which form the glycocalyx and anchor the mucin layer to the hydrophobic
    epithelial cell surface
</p>
<p>
    FUNCTIONS:
</p>
<p>
    · Helps to anchor the tear film to the ocular surface
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Prevents adherence of infective organism
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Stablizes tear film,semisold state,highly hydrated
</p>
<p>
    · Lubricates ocular and palpebral surfaces and reduces friction
</p>
<p>
    · It offers a slippery coating over foreign bodies and protecting cornea
    and conjunctiva against abrasive effects
</p>
<p>
    b. The aqueous layer;
</p>
<p>
    · This layer forms the main bulk of the tear,with a thickness of 10µm.
</p>
<p>
    · Contains inorganic salts, electrolytes (Na+ K+ Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl,HCO <sup>-</sup><sub>3</sub>,
    PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>), Water,glucose,
    urea, enzymes, proteins(Over 60 proteins), glycoproteins, and most of the
    antibacterial substances.

<p>
    · It is secreted by the main and accessory lacrimal glands(Wolfring and
    Krausse).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It has a pH of 6.5 – 7.6
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · It forms the basal tear or normal lacrimation, excessive lacrimation from
    the lacrimal gland results in reflex tears.
</p>
<p>
    FUNCTIONS:
</p>
<p>
    · The protein protect the ocular surface from bacterial infection
</p>
<p>
    · Reflex secretion washes away offending substances from the conjunctival
    and conearl surface
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It provides nutrition to the cornea.
    </li>
    <li>
        It also provides atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> to the epithelium
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Helps maintain a constant pH.
</p>
<p>
    c. The lipid layer;
</p>
<p>
    v Contains waxy esters, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, primarily
    produced by the meibomian glands and zeiss gland.
</p>
<p>
    v The thickness is 0.1 – 0.2 µm and melts at 35oC thus spreading on the
    aqueous layer.
</p>
<p>
    FUNCTIONS:
</p>
<p>
    · Retards evaporation of tears
</p>
<p>
    · Contributes to the optical properties of tear film
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Maintains a hydrophobic barrier <em>(lipid strip) </em>which also
        prevent tear over flow
    </li>
    <li>
        Prevent damage to lid margin skin by tears
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Forms a water tight seal of the opposed lid margins
</p>
<p>
    The new model is composed of;
</p>
<p>
    1. Lipid layer

</p>
<p>
    TEARS
</p>
<p>
    It is clear watery fluid secreted by the lacrimal gland which along with
    the secretions from the meibomian glands,the gland of Zeis and Moll,the
    goblet cells and the accessory lacrimal glands of Krause and Wolfring helps
    to maintain the cornea and the conjunctiva moist and healthy. The normal
    tear volume is about 7 ±2 µL in each eye.
</p>
<p>
    COMPOSITION OF TEAR
</p>
<p>
    • The average pH of tears is 7.35, although a wide normal variation exists
    (5.20–8.35).
</p>
<p>
    • Under normal conditions, tear fluid is isotonic. Tear film osmolarity
    ranges from 295 to 309 mosm/L
</p>
<p>
    • Osmolarity-Normal osmotic pressure is equivalent to 0.9% NaCl solution
</p>
<p>
    • Water as the major component of 98.2%
</p>
<p>
    • Electrolytes-Na<sup>+</sup>,Ca<sup>2+</sup>,Cl<sup>-</sup>,Mg
    <sup>2+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>,HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>,Mn<sup>+</sup>;with
    sodium and chloride present in high concentration
</p>
<p>
    • Vitamins-Vitamin A and Vitamin C
</p>
<p>
    • Albumin constitutes about 60 % of the total protein.
</p>
<p>
    • Immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgE as well as lysozymes make up the
    remaining 40 %.
</p>
<p>
    a) IgA predominates and differs from serum IgA in that it not only
    transudates from serum but is produced by plasma cells located in the
    lacrimal gland.
</p>
<p>
    b) In vernal conjunctivitis, the IgE concentration of tears increases.
</p>
<p>
    c) Tear lysozymes form 21 to 25 % of the total proteins,a proteolytic
    enzyme,net positive charge,produced by acinar cells of lacrimal gland and
    acting synergistically with gamma globulins and other non-lysozyme
    antibacterial factors, they represent an important defense mechanism
    against infection(bacteria;destroys the cell wall of bacteria).
</p>
<p>
    • Tears have a small amount of glucose (5 mg/dL) and urea (0.04 mg/dL), and
    changes in blood concentration produces changes in tear glucose
    <br />
    and urea levels.
</p>
<p>
    • Cells-Include conjunctival,corneal keratinized epithelial
    cells,polymorphs,eosinophils and lymphocytes
</p>
<p>
    • Lipids-Cholesterol esters,fatty acids and free cholesterols etc.
</p>
<p>
    • Glycolytic enzymes,lactate dehydrogenase
</p>
<p>
    • Betalysin-Antibacterial agent
</p>
<p>
    • Mucopoly saccharides
</p>
<p>
    • Mucin(Glycoproteins)
</p>
<p>
    • Amino acids
</p>
<p>
    • Metabolites-Glucose,lactate,pyruvate,urea.
</p>
<p>
    SECRETIONS OF TEAR
</p>
<p>
    The average rate of normal tear secretion is 30-120 microliters per hour or
    0.5 -2.2 micro litres per minute. Premature infants fail to secrete tears,
    while newborn babies secrete tears in the 1st 24 hrs. In young adults, it
    is 2 micro litres per minute, as where as in elderly individual is I micro
    litre per minute.
</p>
<p>
    TYPES OF TEAR SECRETIONS
</p>
<p>
    • Basic tear secretion;
</p>
<p>
    a. It occurs normally without any stimulations and no innervation.
</p>
<p>
    b. Its source are accessory lacrimal glands of Krause and Wolfring, goblet
    cells &amp; tarsal glands
</p>
<p>
    c. It is responsible for maintenance of moistness of cornea and
    conjunctiva.
</p>
<p>
    d. It is reduced in elderly people and in dry eye.
</p>
<p>
    • Reflex tear secretion;
</p>
<p>
    a. It occurs in response to an irritant, i.e.stimulation.
</p>
<p>
    b. It also dependant on psychological(emotional)factors
</p>
<p>
    c. It produced mainly by lacrimal gland and controlled by sympathetic &amp;
    parasympathetic (7th Cranial Nerve) supply.
</p>
<p>
    1) <strong>Sympathetic :</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · act through vasomotor constriction or dilation
</p>
<p>
    · non-medullated nerve fibers from the internal carotid plexus reach the
    gland either around the lacrimal artery or as nerve of pterygoid canal to
    sphenopalatine ganglion → zygomatic nerve → lacrimal gland.
</p>
<p>
    2) <strong>Parasympathetic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Acts<strong> </strong>from the superior salivary or lacrimatory nucleus in
    the brain stem →nervus intermedius (sensory root of facial) → greater
    superficial petrosal nerve → join nerve of pterygoid canal → relay in
    sphenopalatine ganglion → postganglionic fibers → zygomatic nerve →lacrimal
    gland.
    <br />
    <br />
    * Afferent stimulus for reflex tearing:
</p>
<p>
    i. optic nerve.
</p>
<p>
    ii. trigeminal nerve.
</p>
<p>
    iii. facial nerve (sensory part): taste and peppery food.
</p>
<p>
    iv. synkinesis with vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves: tearing with yawing,
    coughing or vomiting.
</p>
<p>
    v. Psychic: with emotions.

</p>
<p align="center">
    ELIMINATION OF TEARS
</p>
<p>
    Tears are eliminated from the eye either by;
</p>
<p>
    a. Evaporation
</p>
<p>
    25% of secreted tears are eliminated when eyes are opened (no evaporation
    when eyes are closed). Evaporation leads to an increase in the tonicity of
    precorneal tear film as water is absorb from the cornea which may result in
    corneal dehydration.
</p>
<p>
    b. Drainage through the nasolacrimal system
</p>
<p>
    • 75% of secreted tears are eliminated through this system
</p>
<p>
    ü Upper puncta (30-35%)
</p>
<p>
    ü Lower puncta (65-70%)
</p>
<p>
    • The tear drains through the lacrimal puncta into the canaliculi then into
    the lacrimal sac into the nasolacrimal duct then into the nose. This is
    done by some mechanism;
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    <strong>a) Passive:</strong>
    by<strong> </strong>gravity and capillary attraction.
    <br />
    <strong>b) Active (lid movement = suction pump):</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · orbicularis contraction during lid closure: dilate the canaliculi and
    draw the lateral wall
    <br />
    of the sac laterally creating a negative pressure and tears are directed to
    the sac.
</p>
<p>
    · orbicularis relaxation during lid opening: ampulla of vertical part of
    canaliculus dilates and the sac collapse and tears are
    <br />
    directed to the nasolacrimal duct.
</p>
<p>
    · Folds or valves present in the nasolacrimal duct prevent
    <br />
    the air within the nose from being drawn up into the drainage system.
</p>
<p>
    The active mechanism has been simplified in a short note detail to
    illustrate on tear drainage;
</p>
<p>
    During closure, the eyelids meet first at the temporal canthus; closure
    then moves toward the medial canthus, where the tears pool in the lacrimal
    lake. The tear menisci are pushed toward the lacrimal puncta into which
    they drain.
</p>
<p>
    Theories explaining tear drainage report that the state of the lacrimal sac
    is either distended or compressed by contraction of the orbicularis muscle.
    According to some, contraction of the lacrimal part of the orbicularis
    compresses the canaliculi, forcing the tears into the lacrimal sac.
</p>
<p>
    Coincidentally, contraction of the muscle pulls on the fascial sheath
    attached to the lacrimal sac, which causes lateral displacement of the
    lateral wall, expanding the sac and creating negative pressure within it;
    in effect, pulling tears in from the canaliculus. On relaxation of the
    orbicularis, the lacrimal sac collapses, and the tears are driven into the
    nasolacrimal duct.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the canaliculi open and act as siphons to pull tears in
    through the puncta. The tears drain into the nasolacrimal duct mainly by
    gravity, where most are absorbed by the mucosal lining before the remaining
    tears enter the inferior meatus. A number of studies, however, have
    measured an increase in pressure within the lacrimal sac during lid
    closure.
</p>
<p>
    Using high-speed photography, the medial edges of the eyelids have been
    observed to meet, halfway into a blink, occluding the puncta. According to
    this theory, the canaliculi and lacrimal sac are compressed, forcing all
    fluids into the nasolacrimal duct.
</p>
<p>
    As the eyelids open, compression of the canaliculi decreases, but the
    puncta remain occluded, creating a negative pressure in the canaliculi.
    When the puncta finally are opened, the negative pressure pulls the tears
    in immediately after the blink.
</p>
<p>
    The primary difference in these two theories is the state of the lacrimal
    sac. In the first scenario the sac is dilated, whereas in the second case
    the sac is compressed with orbicularis contraction. Capillary attraction
    plays a role in moving tears into the puncta and down into the canaliculi
    between blinks.
</p>

</p>
<p align="center">
    TEAR FILM BREAK UP
</p>
<p>
    The normal time is 15 s. Measurement of the tear film breakup time may be
    useful to estimate the mucin content of tears. For the method, apply a
    slightly moistened
    <br />
    fluorescein strip to the bulbar conjunctiva and ask the patient to blink.
</p>
<p>
    The tear film is then scanned with a cobalt filter on the slit lamp while
    the patient refrains from blinking. The time that elapses before the first
    dry spot that appears in the corneal fluorescein layer is the “tear film
    breakup time.” It is definitely reduced in eyes with mucin deficiency.

    <strong><u>THE LACRIMAL APPARATUS</u></strong>
    <strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    OVERVIEW
</p>
<p>
    The structures responsible for the production and drainage of tears are
    collectively called the lacrimal apparatus. The lacrimal apparatus consists
    of two divisions: the secretory and the excretory part.
</p>
<p align="center">
    Fig 4 shows the two divisions of the lacrimal apparatus(secretory and
    excretory part)

</p>
<p align="center">
    THE LACRIMAL SECRETORY SYSTEM
</p>
<p>
    The secretory system includes;
</p>
<p>
    1. The main lacrimal gland:
</p>
<p>
    a. Are paired, almond-shaped exocrine glands, one for each eye, that
    secretes the aqueous layer of the tear film.
</p>
<p>
    b. They are situated in the upper lateral region of each orbit, in the
    lacrimal fossa of the orbit formed by the frontal bone.
</p>
<p>
    2. The accessory lacrimal glands which consist of:
</p>
<p>
    a. Glands of Zeis and Gland of moll;
</p>
<p>
    Glands of Zeis are unilobar sebaceous glands located on the margin of the
    eyelid and it services the eyelash.
</p>
<p>
    The Glands of Moll are apocrine glands located in the same area near the
    eyelid, near the base of the eyelashes.
</p>
<p>
    These glands produce an oily substance that is issued through the excretory
    ducts of the sebaceous lobule into the middle portion of the hair follicle.
</p>
<p>
    b. Krause’s glands and Wolfring’s glands
</p>
<p>
    Krause’s glands are small, mucous accessory lacrimal glands that are found
    underneath the eyelid where the upper and lower conjunctivae meet.
</p>
<p>
    In the upper fornix, 20 to 40 glands of Krause are found, although only six
    to eight such glands appear in the lower fornix.
</p>
<p>
    Its function is to produce tears which are secreted onto the surface of the
    conjunctiva. Wolfring’s glands are small tubular accessory lacrimal glands
    (glandulae lacrimales accessoriae) found in the lacrimal caruncle of the
    eyelid.
</p>
<p>
    They are located in the upper border of the tarsus, approximately in the
    middle between the extremities of the tarsal glands. The glands of Wolfring
    are less numerous.
</p>
<p>
    3. Meibomian glands
</p>
<p>
    Also called tarsal glands. They are holocrine type exocrine glands, along
    the rims of the eyelid inside the tarsal plate. Approximately 30 to 40
    meibomian glands are found in the upper lid and 20 to 30 in the lower lid.
</p>
<p>
    x On eyelid eversion, the vertical rows of the meibomian glands can sometimes
    be seen as yellow streaks through the palpebral conjunctiva. They produce
    meibum, an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the eye’s tear film.
</p>
<p>
    4. The conjunctival goblet cells.
</p>
<p>
    a. Goblet cells are highly specialized epithelial cells, present in mucosal
    tissues along the body.
</p>
<p>
    b. The main function of these cells is to produce and secrete mucins, which
    hydrate and lubricate mucosal surfaces.
</p>
<p>
    c. Goblet cells are confined to the conjunctival epithelium under
    non-pathogenic conditions in the eye.

    <u>THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM OF THE LACRIMAL APPARATUS(</u>
    <u>NASOLACRIMAL DRAINAGE SYSTEM)</u>
</p>
<p>
    Some tear fluid is lost by evaporation and some by reabsorption through
    conjunctival tissue, but approximately 75% is passed through the
    nasolacrimal drainage system. The <strong>nasolacrimal drainage system </strong>consists of;
</p>
<p>
    a. Lacrimal puncta
</p>
<p>
    They are small oval openings situated on small elevations,one in each
    lid,6mm from the medial canthhus at the junction of ciliary and lacrimal
    part of the lid margin.
</p>
<p>
    b. Lacrimal canaliculus
</p>
<p>
    · Are 2 in number, upper and lower; they connect the lacrimal sac with the
    lacrimal punctum.
</p>
<p>
    · It consists of a vertical (2mm)and horizontal portion(6-8mm).
</p>
<p>
    · Usually, each canaliculus opens separately into the lacrimal sac (2.5mm
    below the apex).
</p>
<p>
    · They occasionally join together to form a common canaliculus before
    opening into the lacrimal sac.
</p>
<p>
    · A mucosal fold present at this point to prevent reflux of tear is called
    ”Valve of Rosenmuller”.
</p>
<p>
    c. Lcrimal sac
</p>
<p>
    · It is lodged in the lacrimal fossa,formed by the lacrimal bone and the
    frontal process of the maxilla.
</p>
<p>
    · Portion of the lacrimal sac above the medical palpebral ligament is
    called fundus.
</p>
<p>
    · Distended lacrimal sac measures 15 mm in length and 5-6mm in width.
</p>
<p>
    · It is enclosed by lacrimal fascia.In between the lacrimal sac and the
    fascia lies a fine venus plexus.
</p>
<p>
    d. Nasolacrimal duct
</p>
<p>
    · It is the downward continuation of the lacrimal sac.
</p>
<p>
    · It is 12-24mm in length and 4mm in diameter.
</p>
<p>
    · It is lodged in a bony canal and passes backwards,laterally and downwards
    to open into the inferior meatus of the rose.
</p>
<p>
    · Upper end of the nasolacrimal duct is the narrowest portion.Several
    mucosal valves are described within the nasolacrimal duct.All of them are
    simply mucous membrane fold without any valvular function expect the valve
    of Hasner.
</p>
<p>
    · “Valve of Hasner” is located at the lower end of the nasolacrimal duct.
