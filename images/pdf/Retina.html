    Retina is the sensory neural layer of the eyeball that lies between the
    choroid externally and the vitreous body internally. It is thickest (0.56
    mm) near the optic disc, diminishing to 0.1 mm anterior to the equator, and
    continuing at this thickness to the ora serrata. It thins locally at the
    fovea of the macula. The retina is continuous with the optic nerve at the
    optic disc.
</p>
<p>
    PARTS OF THE RETINA
</p>
<p>
    1. Macula lutea.
</p>
<p>
    - Near the centre of the retina there is a region 5-6 mm in diameter, which
    contains the macula lutea, an elliptical yellowish area, 2mm horizontally
    and 1mm vertically.
</p>
<p>
    - Its colour is due to the presence of xanthophyll derivatives.
</p>
<p>
    2. Fovea centralis or foveola
</p>
<p>
    The macula lutea contains a central depression, the fovea centralis or
    foveola, with a diameter of 0.4 mm, where visual resolution is <strong>highest</strong>. The minute size of the
    foveola is the reason why
    the visual axes must be directed with great accuracy in order to achieve
    the most discriminative vision.
</p>
<p>
    3. Optic disc
</p>
<p>
    It is 1.5mm in diameter. Disc is devoid of photoreceptors and is therefore
    insensitive to light. By ophthalmoscopy it is normally pink but it is much
    paler than the retina, and may be grey or almost white. In <strong>optic atrophy </strong>the capillary vessels
    disappear and the disc
    is then white.
</p>
<p>
    4. Optic nerve
</p>
<p>
    About 3mm medial and 1mm superior to the foveola, the optic nerve becomes
    continuous with the retina at optic disc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE RETINA</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A. The outer pigmented layer
</p>
<p>
    - The pigmented layer is tightly adherent to the choroid throughout.
</p>
<p>
    B. The neural retina
</p>
<p>
    - The neural retina is attached to the choroid only in a peripapillary ring
    around the disc and at the ora serrata.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong>
    Several factors involved in maintaining close approximation between
    photoreceptor cell layer and RPE layer. These factors include: Forces, such
    as IOP, osmotic pressure, fluid transport across the RPE, and presence of
    the vitreous help preserve the position of the neural retina <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The outermost retinal layer, single cell thick,<strong> </strong>consists
    of pigmented hexagonal cells.<strong> </strong>These cells are columnar in
    the area of the<strong> </strong>posterior pole. They are even longer,
    narrower, and more densely<strong> </strong>pigmented in the macular area.<strong> </strong>The cells become larger
    and more cuboidal as the <strong> </strong>layer nears the ora serrata,<strong> </strong>where the
    transition to the pigmented epithelium<strong> </strong>of the ciliary body
    is located.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Because of the orientation of the embryologic<strong> </strong>cells, the
    basal aspect of the cells is adjacent to<strong> </strong>the choroid, and<strong> </strong>the apical surface faces
    the neural retina.<strong> </strong>The basal aspect contains numerous infoldings and is<strong> </strong>adherent
    to its basement membrane, which forms a<strong> </strong>part of Bruch’s membrane of the choroid; <strong>
    </strong>therefore its attachment to the choroid is strong.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Despite its close association with the choroid, the RPE<strong> </strong>is
    considered a part of the retina. This is because it is from the same
    embryologic germ cell layer—neural ectoderm.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The RPE cells contain numerous melanosomes,<strong> </strong>pigment
    granules. Pigment density differs in various parts of the retina <strong> </strong>and in individual cells giving
    the fundus a mottled
    appearance when viewed<strong> </strong>with the ophthalmoscope.
</p>
<p>
    Note: In retina, melanin is densest in the RPE cells located in the macula
    and at the equator.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>THE NEURAL RETINAL</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The neural retina is the site of transformation of light energy into a
    neural signal<strong>. It contains the first three cells </strong>in the
    visual Pathway, “the route by which visual information from the environment
    reaches the brain for interpretation”.
</p>
<p>
    These cells are:
</p>
<p>
    1. Photoreceptor cells
</p>
<p>
    2. Bipolar cells
</p>
<p>
    3. Ganglion cells
</p>
<p>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Photoreceptor cells</strong>
    transform photons of light into a neural signal through the process of
    phototransduction, then transfer this signal to<strong>bipolar cells</strong>, which in turn synapse with
    <strong>ganglion cells</strong>, which transmit the signal from the eye.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Other retinal cells </strong>
    are:
</p>
<p>
    The horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and interplexiform neurons modify and
    integrate the signal before it leaves the eye.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>Photoreceptor cells</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Photoreceptor cells comprises two types of cells, they are:
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Rods</strong>
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Cones</strong><strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    They are special sense cells containing photopigments<strong> </strong>that
    absorb photons of light.<strong> </strong>The cells originally were named
    for their shapes. I.e., rods are rod-shapes and cones are cone-shaped.
</p>
<p>
    More important in the designation of rod or<strong> </strong>cone is the
    level of illumination in which each is<strong> </strong>active. <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Rods are more active in <strong>dim illumination</strong><strong>(Scotopic vision)</strong>, whiles Cones are active
    in <strong>well-lit conditions (photopic vision).</strong><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NB</strong>
    : Visual pigments in the photoreceptors are<strong> </strong>activated on
    excitation by light.

<p>
    F.G 1
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Composition of rods and cones</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Starting nearest the RPE:
</p>
<p>
    (1) The outer segment, containing the visual pigment molecules for the
    conversion of light into neural signals.
</p>
<p>
    (2) A connecting stalk, the cilium
</p>
<p>
    (3) The inner segment, containing the metabolic apparatus.
</p>
<p>
    (4) The outer fiber
</p>
<p>
    (5) The cell body
</p>
<p>
    (6) The inner fiber, which ends in a synaptic terminal.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Outer Segment</strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    The outer segment is made up of a stack of membranous discs and is enclosed
    by the plasmalemma of the cell
</p>
<p>
    • Visual pigment molecules are located within the disc membranes.
</p>
<p>
    -A biochemical change is initiated within these molecules when activated by
    a photon of light.
</p>
<p>
    • The tip of the outer segment is oriented toward the RPE.
</p>
<p>
    • The base is oriented toward the inner segment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cilium.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • A connecting stalk, extends from the innermost disc, joining the outer
    segment with the inner segment.
</p>
<p>
    • acting as a conduit between them
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Inner Segment.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Contains cellular structures and can be divided into two parts. These
    are:
</p>
<p>
    1. The ellipsoid
</p>
<p>
    2. The myoid
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>The ellipsoid</strong>
</p>
<p>
    - This is nearer the outer segment and contains numerous mitochondria.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>The myoid</strong>
</p>
<p>
    - is closer to the cell body, contains other cellular organelles, such as
    the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus; protein synthesis is
    concentrated in this area
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Outer Fiber, Cell Body, and Inner Fiber.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • The outer fiber extends from the inner segment to the cell body, “the
    portion containing the nucleus”.
</p>
<p>
    • The inner fiber is an axonal process containing microtubules and runs
    inward from the cell body, ending in specialized synaptic terminals that
    contain synaptic vesicles.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rods</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The plasmalemma, enclosing the rod outer segment, is separate from the disc
    membrane except for a small region at the base where invaginations of the
    plasmalemma form discs, the intradisc space of which is continuous with the
    extracellular space.(refer to F.G 1)
</p>
<p>
    • Discs are fairly uniform in width.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>NB</strong>
    : The photosensitive pigment of rod is <strong>rhodopsin </strong>and is
    located within the disc membrane.
</p>
<p>
    · Rod cells detect a broad range of colours(wavelength)
</p>
<p>
    The discs gradually are displaced outward by the formation of new discs as
    they reach the tip, they are sloughed off, taken up by the RPE cells, and
    phagocytosed
</p>
<p>
    • This process is called <strong>rod outer segment renewal system.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • The discs apparently are shed regularly, with most of the shedding
    occurring in the early morning.
</p>
<p>
    The inner fiber extends from the cell body and terminates in a rounded,
    pear-shaped structure called a <strong>spherule</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • The internal surface of the spherule is invaginated, forming a synaptic
    complex that contains bipolar dendrites and horizontal cell processes.
</p>
<p>
    • Each rod spherule synapses with one to four bipolar cells.
</p>
<p>
    • Rods release the neurotransmitter <strong>glutamate</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cones.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • The outer segment of the cone is enclosed by a plasmalemma, but plasma
    membrane is continuous with the membranes forming most of the discs, discs
    are not separated easily from one another
</p>
<p>
    The cone outer segment is shorter than that of rod and may not reach the
    RPE layer.
</p>
<p>
    • However, tubular processes protrude from the apical surface of the
    epithelial cell to surround the cone outer segment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        NOTE: Unlike the rod that has only one photosensitive pigment (I.e.,
        rhodopsin), cone has three types of visual pigment (I.e., iodopsin).
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Also, unlike rod cells that are sensitive a broad range of colours
        (wavelength), cone cells are sensitive to specific colour wavelength
        (red, green, blue)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Each of the three pigment molecule is activated by the absorption of
    light in a specific range in the color spectrum.
</p>
<p>
    • The absorptions occur at 420 nm (blue), 531nm (green), and 588 nm (red).
</p>
<p>
    *The outer fiber is short and stout and may even be absent in the cone.
</p>
<p>
    *Unlike rods that can synapse with one to four bipolar cells, cones have a
    strictly one-to-one relationships with bipolar cells.
</p>
<p>
    • The inner fiber terminates in a broad, flattened structure called a <strong>pedicle</strong>, which has several
    invaginated areas within its
    flattened surface.
</p>
<p>
    • Cones also use <strong>glutamate</strong> for a neurotransmitter.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        NOTE: Photoreceptor nerve endings synapse with bipolar and horizontal
        cells.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bipolar cells</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Is the second-order neuron in the visual pathway.
</p>
<p>
    • The nucleus of the bipolar cell is large.
</p>
<p>
    • Its dendrite synapses with photoreceptor and horizontal cells,
</p>
<p>
    • Its axon synapses with ganglion and amacrine cells.
</p>
<p>
    • Glutamate is its neurotransmitter
</p>
<p>
    Relay information from photoreceptors to horizontal, amacrine, and ganglion
    cells.
</p>
<p>
    • receive extensive synaptic feedback from amacrine cells.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Ganglion cells</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • The third-order neuron in the visual pathway.
</p>
<p>
    • Can be bipolar (a single axon and a single dendrite) or multipolar (a
    single axon and more than one dendrite).
</p>
<p>
    Ganglion cells transfers information in a horizontal direction parallel to
    the retinal surface.
</p>
<p>
    *Glutamate is its neurotransmitter.
</p>
<p>
    • It has one long process, or axon, and several short dendrites with
    branching terminals;
</p>
<p>
    • The processes spread out parallel to the retinal surface, and all
    terminate in the outer plexiform layer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        NOTE: Horizontal cells synapse with photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and
        other horizontal cells
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        NOTE: All the photoreceptors have Glutamate as their neurotransmitters.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        NOTE: Photoreceptors and bipolar cells produce gradient potential
        whiles, Ganglion cells produce action potential.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>QUESTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Why does ganglion cells produce action potential?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>ANSWER</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is because, they have the responsibility of carrying out the nerve
    impulses to the central nervous system for final processing. Hence, they
    need energy to do so.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Amacrine cells</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Has a large cell body, a lobulated nucleus, a single process with
    extensive branches that extend into the inner plexiform layer.
</p>
<p>
    • The process, has both dendritic and axonal characteristics
</p>
<p>
    • Carries information horizontally
</p>
<p>
    • Forms complex synapses with axons of bipolar cells, dendrites and soma of
    ganglion cells
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Neuroglial cells</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Do not actively involved in the transfer of neural signals,
</p>
<p>
    • provide structure and support and play a role in the neural tissue
    reaction to injury or infection.
</p>
<p>
    • Types of neuroglial cells found in the retina include:
</p>
<p>
    - Müller cells
</p>
<p>
    -microglial cells and
</p>
<p>
    - Astrocytes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Retinal Histologic Features </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Under light microscopy the retina has a laminar<strong> </strong>appearance
    in which 10 layers are evident.<strong> </strong>Closer examination reveals
    that these are not all<strong> </strong>“layers,”<strong> </strong>but
    rather a single layer of pigmented epithelium<strong> </strong>and three
    layers of neuronal cell bodies,<strong> </strong>between which lie their
    processes and synapses.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Ten Retinal Layers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Traditionally, descriptive names were given to these so called layers.
</p>
<p>
    • They are:
</p>
<p>
    • 1. Retinal pigment epithelium
</p>
<p>
    • 2. Photoreceptor cell layer
</p>
<p>
    • 3. External limiting membrane
</p>
<p>
    • 4. Outer nuclear layer
</p>
<p>
    5. Outer plexiform layer
</p>
<p>
    • 6. Inner nuclear layer
</p>
<p>
    • 7. Inner plexiform layer
</p>
<p>
    • 8. Ganglion cell layer
</p>
<p>
    • 9. Nerve fiber layer
</p>
<p>
    • 10. Internal limiting membrane

        alt="Image" />

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Retinal pigment epithelium</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • There are 4 to 6 million RPE cells, and each cell interacts with 30 to 40
    photoreceptors.
</p>
<p>
    • Functions:
</p>
<p>
    • First, the zonula occludens of the RPE are an important part of the
    blood-retinal barrier.
</p>
<p>
    • It selectively controls movement of substances from the choriocapillaris
    into the retina.
</p>
<p>
    Second, cellular lysosomes within the cells enable the cells to phagocytose
    fragments from the continual shedding of the photoreceptor outer segment
    discs.
</p>
<p>
    • Third, the RPE metabolizes and stores vitamin A, which is used in the
    formation of photopigment molecules.
</p>
<p>
    Fourth, the pigment granules within the cells absorb light, reducing excess
    scattering.
</p>
<p>
    • Fifth, the cells contribute to the formation of the intercellular complex
    between the RPE layer and the photoreceptors.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Photoreceptor Layer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Composed of the outer and inner segments of rods and cones.
</p>
<p>
    • Projections from the apical surface of Müller cells separate the inner
    segments.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>External Limiting Membrane</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Not a true membrane.
</p>
<p>
    • It actually consists of intercellular junctions between photoreceptor
    cells and Müller cells at the level of the inner segments
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Outer Nuclear Layer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Contains the rod and cone cell bodies;
</p>
<p>
    • The cone cell body and nucleus are larger than those of the rod.
</p>
<p>
    • Cone outer fibers are very short, therefore the cone nuclei lie in a
    single layer close to the external limiting membrane.
</p>
<p>
    Cell bodies of the rods are arranged in several rows inner to the cone cell
    bodies.
</p>
<p>
    • The ONL is thickest in the fovea,
</p>
<p>
    • It contains approximately 10 layers of cone nuclei.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Outer Plexiform Layer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Also outer synaptic layer<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Rod spherules and cone pedicles synapse with bipolar and horizontal cells
    in the OPL.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Inner Nuclear Layer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Consists of the cell bodies of horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine
    cells, interplexiform neurons, Müller cells, and some displaced ganglion
    cells.
</p>
<p>
    The nuclei of the horizontal cells are located next to the outer plexiform
    layer, where their processes synapse
</p>
<p>
    The nuclei of the amacrine cells are located next to the inner plexiform
    layer, where their processes terminate.
</p>
<p>
    The bipolar cell has its dendrite in the outer plexiform layer and its axon
    in the inner plexiform layer
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Inner Plexiform Layer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Also inner synaptic layer
</p>
<p>
    • Consists of synaptic connections between axons of bipolar cells and
    dendrites of ganglion cells.
</p>
<p>
    • I.e. it contains the synapse between the second order and third order
    neurons in the visual pathway.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Ganglion Cell Layer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Is generally a single cell thick,
</p>
<p>
    • Except near the macula, where it might be 8 to 10 cells thick,
</p>
<p>
    • And at the temporal side of the optic disc, where it is two cells thick.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Nerve Fiber Layer</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Also stratum opticum<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Consists of the ganglion cell axons.
</p>
<p>
    • Their course runs parallel to the retinal surface;
</p>
<p>
    • The fibers proceed to the optic disc, turn at a right angle, and exit the
    eye through the lamina cribrosa as the optic nerve.
</p>
<p>
    • The fibers generally are unmyelinated within the retina.
</p>
<p>
    The group of fibers that radiate to the disc from the macular area is
    called the papillomacular bundle.
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: This important grouping of fibers carries the information that
    determines visual acuity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Internal Limiting Membrane</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Forms the innermost boundary of the retina.
</p>
<p>
    • The outer retinal surface of this membrane is uneven.
</p>
<p>
    • The inner or vitreal surface is smooth.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Number and distribution of neural cells</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Total no of rods is 110 to 125 million.
</p>
<p>
    • No of cones is 6.3 to 6.8 million
</p>
<p>
    • The density of rods is greater than that of cones except in the macular
    region, where cones are concentrated;
</p>
<p>
    • Rods are absent from the fovea, the macular center.
</p>
<p>
    The number of both rods and cones diminishes toward the ora serrata
</p>
<p>
    • There are approximately 35.68 million bipolar cells and 1.12 to 2.22
    million ganglion cells.
</p>
<p>
    • The signals from numerous photoreceptors converge at one ganglion cell,
    indicating integration and refinement of the initial response of the
    photoreceptor cells.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Regions of Retina</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Retina consists of two regions, peripheral and central.
</p>
<p>
    • The peripheral retina is designated for detecting gross form and motion,
    the central area is specialized for visual acuity
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Central Retina</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Macula Lutea</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Appears as a darkened region in the central retina and may seem to have a
    yellow hue because of the xanthophyll pigments, lutein and zeaxanthin.
</p>
<p>
    • These pigments have been found throughout the retina, with the greatest
    concentration in the plexiform layers of the macula.
</p>
<p>
    The newborn has little if any of these pigments, but they gradually
    accumulate from diet.
</p>
<p>
    • These pigments act as filters to reduce chromatic aberration.
</p>
<p>
    • Also have an antioxidant effect- protective role against UV radiation
    damage.
</p>
<p>
    • Guard against damaging effects of free radicals.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    • The macula lutea is approximately 5.5 mm in diameter;

    • its center is approximately 3.5 mm lateral to the edge of the disc and
    approximately 1 mm inferior to the center of the disc.
</p>
<p>
    The pigment epithelial cells are taller,
</p>
<p>
    • contain more pigment than cells elsewhere in the retina,
</p>
<p>
    • contributes to the darkness of this area.
</p>
<p>
    • However, the intensity of the pigment varies greatly from person to
    person.
</p>
<p>
    • The choroidal capillary bed also is thicker in the macula lutea than
    elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
    The entire macular region consists of:
</p>
<p>
    • The fovea
</p>
<p>
    • The foveola
</p>
<p>
    • And the parafoveal area and perifoveal area.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fovea (Fovea Centralis).</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Within the fovea is a capillary-free zone 0.4 to 0.5 mm in diameter.
</p>
<p>
    • This allows light to pass unobstructed into the photoreceptor’s outer
    segment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Foveola.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • The diameter of the foveola is approximately 0.35 mm.
</p>
<p>
    • At the foveola the retina is approximately 0.13mm thick, compared to 0.18
    mm at the equator and 0.11 mm at the ora serrata.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Parafoveal and Perifoveal Areas</strong>
    <strong><em>.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    • The annular zone surrounding the fovea can be divided into an inner
    parafoveal area and an outer perifoveal area.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Optic Disc</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • Or optic nerve head, is the site where ganglion cell axons accumulate and
    exit the eye.
</p>
<p>
    • The horizontal diameter of the disc is approximately 1.7 mm and the
    vertical diameter approximately 1.9 mm.
</p>
<p>
    • The number of nerve fibers appears to be positively correlated with the
    size of the optic nerve head and larger discs have relatively more fibers
    than smaller discs.
</p>
<p>
    It is paler than the surrounding retina because there is no RPE.
</p>
<p>
    • The pale-yellow or salmon color of the optic disc is a combination of the
    scleral lamina cribrosa and the capillary network.
</p>
<p>
    Because the disc contains no photoreceptor cells, light incident on the
    disc does not elicit a response.
</p>
<p>
    • Thus it represents the physiologic blind spot.
</p>
<p>
    • A depression in the surface of the disc, the physiologic cup.

<p align="center">
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>RETINAL TEAR</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A retinal tear occurs when the vitreous humour shrinks and tugs on the
    retina with enough traction to cause a break in the retina, it is often
    accompanied by the sudden onsets of symptoms such as floaters and flashing
    lights.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>RETINAL DETACHMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A retinal detachment is defined by the presence of fluid under the retina.
    This usually occurs when fluid passes through a retina tear causing the
    retina to lift away from the underlying tissue layer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>DIABETIC RETINOPATHY</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the back of your eyes can
    deteriorate and leak fluid into and under the retina if you are diabetic.
    This causes the retina to swell, which may blur or distort your vision.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong>MACULA HOLE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A macular hole is a small defect in the center of the retina (macula). The
    hole may develop from abnormal traction between the retina and the vitreous
    or it may follow an injury to the eye.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. </strong>
    <strong>RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited degenerative disease. It slowly
    affects the retina and causes loss of night
