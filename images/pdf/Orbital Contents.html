    OVERVIEW:
</p>
<p>
    The volume of the orbit is 30ml. The eyeball occupies only 20% of the
    orbital volume. The rest is occupied by other structures. Orbital Contents
    are the structures that fill the space in the bony orbit. They include; the
    eyeball, fat, connective tissues, extrinsic muscles, lacrimal apparatus,
    and nerves and vessels which supply these structures.
</p>
<p>
    Connective tissues: periorbita, tenon’s capsule, orbital septum
</p>
<p>
    Orbital fat: 4 compartments, cushions the eyeball.
</p>
<p>
    Extraocular muscles, Vessels, Nerves: discussed in different sections.
</p>
<p>
    CONNECTIVE TISSUES OF THE ORBIT
</p>
<p>
    The connective tissue of the orbit is arranged in a network that serves to
    line, cover, and compartmentalize orbital structures; to anchor soft tissue
    structures to bone; and to compartmentalize areas.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong><u> Periorbita</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The periorbita, also called the orbital periosteum or orbital fascia,
    covers the bones of the orbit. This dense connective tissue membrane serves
    as:
</p>
<p>
    a. An attachment site for muscles, tendons, and ligaments
</p>
<p>
    b. A support structure for the blood supply to the orbital bones.
</p>
<p>
    The periorbita is attached only loosely to the underlying bone except at
    the orbital margins, the sutures, and the edges of fissures and foramina.
    At the orbital margins it is continuous with the periosteal covering of the
    bones of the face; at the edges of the superior orbital fissure, the optic
    canal, and the ethmoid canals, the periorbita is continuous with the
    periosteal layer of the dura mater.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong><u>Orbital Septum</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    At the orbital margins the periorbita is continuous with a connective
    tissue sheet known as the orbital septum, also termed the palpebral fascia
    or septum orbitale.
</p>
<p>
    This dense connective tissue sheet is circular and runs from the entire rim
    of the orbit to the tarsal plates, which are embedded in the eyelids.
</p>
<p>
    This strong barrier helps prevent facial infections from entering the
    orbit; it also maintains orbital fat in its place.
</p>
<p>
    At the lateral margin the orbital septum lies in front of the lateral
    palpebral ligament and the check ligament for the lateral rectus muscle.
</p>
<p>
    At the superior orbital margin, the orbital septum passes in front of the
    trochlea and bridges the supraorbital and supratrochlear notches.
</p>
<p>
    At the medial margin the orbital septum, which attaches behind the
    posterior lacrimal crest, lies in front of the check ligament for the
    medial rectus muscle; it lies behind the medial palpebral ligament,
    Horner’s muscle, and the lacrimal.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong><u>Tenon’s Capsule</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Tenon’s capsule is a sheet of dense connective tissue that encases the
    globe.
</p>
<p>
    Tenon's capsule has a smooth inner surface, pierced by vessels and nerves,
    and fuses with the sheath of the optic nerve and with the sclera.
</p>
<p>
    It lies between the conjunctiva and the episclera and merges with them
    anteriorly in the limbal area. Posteriorly, it emerges with the dual sheath
    of the optic nerve.
</p>
<p>
    Function: It acts as a barrier to prevent the spread of orbital infections
    into the globe
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Piercings &amp; Openings of The Tenon’s Capsule</strong>
</p>
<p>
    These are structures that pierce and enter the globe;
</p>
<p>
    1. Optic nerve
</p>
<p>
    2. Vortex veins
</p>
<p>
    3. Ciliary nerves
</p>
<p>
    4. Extraocular muscles
</p>
<p>
    Mnemonic: OVEC
</p>

</p>
<p>
    NB: Tenon’s capsule, or fascia bulbi, extends anteriorly from the dural
    sheath to encircle the globe and fuse with the conjunctiva just behind the
    limbus. Posteriorly it separates orbital fat from the globe and muscles.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Thickenings &amp; Support of the Tenon’s Capsule</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Check Ligament; attaches it to the orbital wall medially and laterally.
</p>
<p>
    2. Suspensory ligament of Lockwood: supports it at the inferior side.
</p>
<p>
    3. Actions of the medial and lateral recti muscles.
</p>
<p>
    NB: The capsule is thickest at the inferior side and this increases support
    of the eyeball by forming “hammock-like” suspensory ligament of Lockwood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong><u>Suspensory Ligament of Lockwood</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is a hammocklike sheet of dense connective tissue that runs from its
    attachment on the lacrimal bone at the medial orbital wall to the zygomatic
    bone at the lateral wall.
</p>
<p>
    The suspensory ligament helps to support the globe, particularly in the
    absence of the bones of the orbital floor.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. </strong>
    <strong><u>Orbital Fat</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Four adipose tissue compartments fill the empty spaces not occupied by any
    structure.
</p>
<p>
    Function: Orbital fat provides cushioned support for the globe and other
    intraocular structures.
</p>
<p>
    Eyelid fat pads are the anterior projections of the orbital fat. Changes in
    orbital fat appear to have a significant role in the development of
    thyroidassociated orbitopathy (TAO). Orbital fat and extraocular muscle
    volume expansion may result in soft tissue swelling, proptosis, lid
    retraction (with characteristic temporal flare), strabismus (usually due to
    muscle fibrosis), and compressive optic neuropathy.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>6. </strong>
    <strong><u>Orbital Muscle of Muller</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    A small smooth muscle embedded in the periorbita and covering part of the
    inferior orbital fissure.
</p>
<p>
    Function: It’s function in humans is unknown.
