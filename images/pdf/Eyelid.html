<p>
    OVERVIEW:
</p>
<p>
    Eyelids are moveable skin folds of tissues that cover the front of the
    orbit. The eyelid is one of the ocular adnexa. The eyelid has the thinnest
    skin in the body. It has structures that produce tear film.
</p>
<p>
    The eyelids are important for protection and maintenance of normal ocular
    health and function.
</p>
<p>
    1. Barrier function
</p>
<p>
    • Eyelid closure provides a barrier function elicited by voluntary or
    reflexive Blinking.
</p>
<p>
    2. Maintenance of globe position
</p>
<p>
    • The eyelids apply gentle posterior pressure on the globe to counteract
    forward pressure from orbital tissues behind the globe.
</p>
<p>
    3. Ocular surface integrity.
</p>
<p>
    • Blinking distributes tears across the ocular surface and promotes
    drainage of tears via the lacrimal pump mechanism.
</p>
<p>
    4. Eyelid glands
</p>
<p>
    • The eyelid contains glands with secretions that add to the tear film.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>EYEBROWS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Eyebrows consists of thick skin covered by characteristic, short, prominent
    hairs extending across the superior orbital margin. Eyebrows are the first
    body hairs produced during embryologic development.
</p>
<p>
    Eyebrow position and contour are maintained by a group of muscles
    innervated by the temporal branch of the facial nerve (CN VII).
</p>
<p>
    The muscles of the eyebrow and forehead may be divided into
</p>
<p>
    a. Superficial (frontalis, procerus, orbicularis oculi),
</p>
<p>
    b. Intermediate (depressor supercilii)
</p>
<p>
    c. Deep (corrugator supercilii)
</p>

</p>
<p>
    FM: frontalis muscle OM: orbicularis muscle CSM: corrugated superciilli
    muscle PM: Procerus muscle DSM: Depressor supercilli muscle
</p>
<p>
    Arrangement:
</p>
<p>
    a. Males: The brows run along orbital margin.
</p>
<p>
    b. Females: the brows run above the orbital margin.
</p>
<p>
    Eyebrow redirects sweat away from the eyes. The skin of the eyebrows and
    its subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue are the thickest layers on the face.
</p>
<p>
    • It plays an important role in facial expression
</p>
<p>
    Movement:
</p>
<p>
    There are 4 muscles that produce the eyebrow and facial movements.
</p>
<p>
    a. Frontalis: raises the eyebrow, causing a look of surprise or attention.
</p>
<p>
    b. Corrugator superciliasis: it moves the brow medially, toward the nose,
    creating vertical furrows between the brows.
</p>
<p>
    c. Procerus: muscle of menace or aggression, pulls the medial portion of
    the eyebrow inferiorly and produces horizontal furrows over the bridge of
    the nose.
</p>
<p>
    d. The orbicularis oculi: lowers the entire brow.
</p>

<p>
    <strong><u>EYELID</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The eyelid, AKA palpebrae, are folds of skin that cover the globe when
    closed. The space between the upper and lower eyelids that exposes the
    eyeball is called palpebral fissure.
</p>
<p>
    The upper eyelid is more movable than the lower and contains in its
    superior margin, the levator palpebral superioris muscle.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dimensions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    • In adults, the normal interpalpebral fissure height is 8–11 mm; the
    horizontal palpebral fissure length is 27–30 mm.
</p>
<p>
    • The upper lid margin rests 1.5–2 mm below the limbus; the lower rests on
    the Limbus.
</p>

    />
</p>
<p>
    The eye lid is composed of skin (epidermis and dermis), eyelid margin
    sub-cutaneous tissue, the orbicularis oculi, Orbital septum, levator
    muscle, MÜller muscle, Tarsal plates, tarsal glands, and the conjunctiva.

</p>
<p>
    EYELID MARGIN:
</p>
<p>
    The eyelid margin may be divided into anterior and posterior lamella.
</p>
<p>
    The anterior lamella is composed of
</p>
<p>
    - skin, muscle, and associated glands (Zeiss and Moll),
</p>
<p>
    The posterior lamella consists of
</p>
<p>
    - the tarsal plate, conjunctiva, and associated glands (Meibomian).
</p>
<p>
The two lamellae may be separated from one another along the    <strong>gray line (intermaginal sulcus)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    A terminal extension of the orbicularis known as the muscle of Riolan keeps
    the eyelid edges close to the surface of the globe as well as help expel
    glandular contents during blinking.
</p>
<p>
    Eyelid closure
</p>
<p>
    • Reflex blinking provides rapid closure of the eye in response to splash
    or foreign body sensation.
</p>
<p>
    Bell’s phenomenon
</p>
<p>
    • A normal Bell’s phenomenon provides involuntary upward rotation of the
    globe on lid closure, removing the cornea from noxious stimuli. Clinical
    Notes: Bell’s palsy

</p>
<p>
    Structure
</p>
<p>
    1. Anterior lamella:
</p>
<p>
    The anterior lamella functions as a single unit, consisting of skin, muscle
    (orbicularis oculi), and associated glands (Glands of Zeiss and Moll)
</p>
<p>
    (i) Skin
</p>
<p>
    • The eyelid skin is thinnest, allowing rapid and large movements on eyelid
    opening and closure. The eyelid skin is the thinnest in the body, due to
    relative thinning of dermis and absence of a subcutaneous fat layer.
</p>
<p>
    It contains; fine hairs (eyelashes) 2-3 irregular rows. Upper eyelashes are
    longer and more; the sebaceous and sweat glands.
</p>
<p>
    Eyelashes:
</p>
<p>
    - Are sensitive to touch (protects the eye)
</p>
<p>
    - Elicit the blink reflex
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Muscle: the orbicularis oculi
</p>
<p>
    • The orbicularis oculi (OO) are a flat, elliptical muscle surrounding the
    orbital margin and extending onto the cheek, eyelids, and around the
    lacrimal sac. The major protractor of the eyelids is the orbicularis
    muscle.
</p>
<p>
    It is skeletal and has varying short myofibers. The variability in myofiber
    length may help to explain the variety of complex eyelid movements
    including blinking, winking, and spasm.
</p>
<p>
    The short muscle fibers connected by myomyous junctions. It is the thinnest
    muscle fibers of the face.
</p>
<p>
    Innervated by the facial nerve.
</p>
<p>
    • OO has three functional divisions;
</p>
<p>
    - Orbital: forced eyelid closure
</p>
<p>
    - Preseptal: voluntary eyelid closure, regulates lacrimal pucta
</p>
<p>
    - Pretarsal: spontaneous blinking
</p>
<p>
    <img
    width="300" height="210"
        src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/iris-97f18.appspot.com/o/Eyelid%20pic%207.png?alt=media&token=b157feac-924b-4919-9800-cf6921974a53"
    />
</p>
<p>
    • Contraction of the OO on blinking aids the lacrimal pump
</p>
<p>
    • The muscle of Riolan, the pretarsal portion of OO adjacent to the lid
    margin, helps rotate the lashes out during lid closure and releases
    secretions from Meibomian gland.
</p>
<p>
    <img
    width="300" height="210"
        src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/iris-97f18.appspot.com/o/Eyelid%20pic%208.png?alt=media&token=b215cce9-feeb-4f1f-92b7-4f26485389f2"
    />
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Glands
</p>
<p>
    • The glands of Zeiss (modified sebaceous glands) and Moll (modified sweat
    glands) are found in the anterior lamellae near the eyelash cilia. Both
    secrete their contents around the lash follicle.
</p>
<p>
    (iv) Cilia
</p>
<p>
    • Cilia are modified hairs found on eyelid and lid margin skin that protect
    the eye from large airborne particles.
</p>
<p>
    • There are 100–150 on the upper lid and 75 on the lower lid and are
    replaced every 3–5 months.
</p>
<p>
    • Cilia are sensory organs; stimulation results in reflex blinking.
</p>
<p>
    2. Posterior lamella
</p>
<p>
    The posterior lamella is composed of tarsal plate, conjunctiva, and
    associated Glands (tarsal glands).
</p>
<p>
    (i) The tarsal plates
</p>
<p>
    Tarsal plates are composed of collagen fibers (types I and III collagen) as
    well as components more typical of cartilage (aggrecan, chondroitins 4 and
    6 sulfate).
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>Function:</u></em>
    They provide both rigidity and allow for dynamic movement of the eyelids.
    It also provides strength and protection.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Glands
</p>
<p>
    The tarsal plates of both the upper and lower eyelids contain the sebaceous
    meibomian glands. There are approximately 25 in the upper eyelid and 20 in
    the lower eyelid.
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>Function:</u></em>
    They secrete the lipid layer (outer layer) of the tear film which helps
    prevents evaporation of the tears.
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>The accessory glands are found in the conjunctiva.</u></em>
</p>
<p>
    Clinical NB:
</p>
<p>
    In the setting of meibomian gland dysfunction, the relative absence of the
    lipid layer may result in <u>dry eyes</u>. Chronic inflammation of the
    glands or <u>meibomitis,</u> may lead to
</p>
<p>
    - Dysplastic hair follicles that curve towards the globe. It could be as a
    result of;
</p>
<p>
    1. distichiasis (misdirected lashes from the meibomian gland orifices) or
</p>
<p>
    2. trichiasis (misdirection of normal eyelash follicles
</p>
<p>
    - Treatment: may include
</p>
<p>
    cryotherapy, argon laser, electrolysis, trephination and other
    lid-modifying modalities
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Conjunctiva
</p>
<p>
Tightly bound to the posterior aspect of the tarsal plates is the    <u>palpebral conjunctiva</u>. It consists of a non-keratinized stratified
    columnar epithelium overlying loose connective tissue known as substantia
    propria.
</p>
<p>
    The accessory glands of
</p>
<p>
    <u>Wolfring</u>
    : located in the tarsal conjunctiva, and
</p>
<p>
    <u>Krause:</u>
    located in conjunctival fornix,
</p>
<p>
    Function: Both help to produce the aqueous layer of the tear film.
</p>
<p>
    This middle layer of the tear film is tightly bound to the hydrophilic
    mucin layer (inner layer) produced from conjunctival goblet cells.
</p>
<p>
    Eyelid Movements
</p>
<p>
    1. Opening
</p>
<p>
    Eyelid movements are linked to gaze, such that the eyelids move up on
    upward gaze and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
    • Contracture of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle (innervated by the
    oculomotor nerve) elevates the upper eyelid approximately 15 mm
</p>
<p>
    • Muller’s muscle (smooth muscle, sympathetically innervated) contributes
    an additional 1–2 mm of upper lid elevation.
</p>
<p>
    • The lower lid is moved inferiorly (5 mm) by the inferior retractors
    linked to the inferior rectus and inferior oblique by the capsulopalpebral
    fascia.
</p>
<p>
    2. Closure
</p>
<p>
    • Closure is due primarily to OO contraction; additionally there is
    simultaneous levator palpaebrae superioris relaxation.
</p>
<p>
    3. Eyelid motor control
</p>
<p>
    • Eyelid opening and closure is controlled in the frontal cortex close to
    the oculogyric centers.
</p>
<p>
    • The caudal central nucleus of the oculomotor complex in the midbrain
    supplies the levator palpebrae superioris.
</p>
<p>
    • Both eyelids obey Hering’s law: they are linked as yolk muscles and
    bilaterally.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Blinking</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Blinking can be spontaneous, reflex, or voluntary.
</p>
<p>
    Blinking assists in the maintenance of a normal ocular tear surface. A
    blink initiates a cycle of secretion, dispersal, evaporation, and drainage
    of tears.
</p>
<p>
    • Blinking results from simultaneous:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Contraction of the eyelid protractors (orbicularis oculi, corrugator,
    and procerus muscles)
</p>
<p>
    (b) Relaxation of the eyelid retractors (levator palpebrae superioris and
    frontalis muscles)
</p>
<p>
    1. Spontaneous blinking
</p>
<p>
    • This occurs every 3–8 s, lasting 0.3–0.4 s with a blink rate of 12bpm.
</p>
<p>
    • The spontaneous blink rate is affected by:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Environment (dry, moist, dust, bright)
</p>
<p>
    (b) Emotional state (anxiety, concentration)
</p>
<p>
    (c) Some disease states (e.g., Parkinson’s disease)
</p>
<p>
    NB: The pretarsal portion of the orbicularis muscle is thought to be
    responsible for spontaneous blinking.
</p>
<p>
    2. Reflex blinking
</p>
<p>
    • Reflex blinking occurs rapidly in response to the following stimulus
    types:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Tactile: corneal, eyelash, eyelid skin, and eyebrow contact
</p>
<p>
    (b) Optical: dazzle (bright lights), menace (unexpected or threatening
</p>
<p>
    objects)
</p>
<p>
    (c) Auditory (menace)
</p>
<p>
    • The tactile blinking reflex is served by a simple neural circuit
    consisting of the trigeminal nerve (afferent arm) and facial nerve
    (efferent arm).
</p>
<p>
    • It can be modified by supranuclear influences.
</p>
<p>
    • The dazzle reflex is mediated at a subcortical level via the supraoptic
    nucleus and superior colliculus, while the menace reflex mediated at a
    cortical level.
</p>
<p>
    • The afferent information for both reflexes is transmitted via the optic
    nerve.
</p>
<p>
    3. Voluntary blinking
</p>
<p>
    • The amplitude of voluntary blinking is usually larger than reflex and
    spontaneous blinking as all three divisions of OO may be used
</p>
