<p>
    The crystalline lens is a biconvex, avascular and a transparent elliptic
    structure that aids in focusing light rays on the retina.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Structure of lens</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The lens has an anterior and a posterior surface with the posterior surface
    being more curved. The central elevation of both surfaces is anterior and
    posterior poles respectively.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>How the lens receives nourishment</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Since the lens is avascular, it receives nourishment from the aqueous
    humour.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Position of the lens</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The lens is located within posterior chamber, anterior to the posterior
    chamber and posterior to the iris. It is suspended behind the iris by the
    zonules which connects it to the ciliary body.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Transparency of the lens</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Factors that contributes to the transparency of lens includes:
</p>
<p>
    1. Crystallins
</p>
<p>
    2. Absence of membrane-bound organelles in fibers
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Crystallins</strong> are water-soluble proteins that compose
    over 90% of the protein within the lens. The three main crystallins types
    found in the human eye are α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. Crystallins tend to
    form soluble, high-molecular weight aggregates that pack tightly in lens
    fibers, thus increasing the index of refraction of the lens while
    maintaining its transparency. β and γ crystallins are found primarily in
    the lens, while subunits of α -crystallin have been isolated from other
    parts of the eye and the body. α-crystallin proteins belong to a larger
    superfamily of molecular chaperone proteins, and so it is believed that the
    crystallin proteins were evolutionarily recruited from chaperone proteins
    for optical purposes. The chaperone functions of α-crystallin may also help
    maintain the lens proteins, which must last a human for their entire
    lifetime.
</p>
<p>
    2. Another important factor in maintaining the transparency of the lens is
    the absence of light-scattering organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic
    reticulum, and mitochondria within the mature lens fibers. Lens fibers also
    have a very extensive cytoskeleton that maintains the precise shape and
    packing of the lens fibers; disruptions/mutations in certain cytoskeletal
    elements can lead to the loss of transparency.

    1. Cells that form the lens are originally part of the surface ectoderm
    covering the head of the embryo.
</p>
<p>
    2. Neural epithelial cells in the embryonic forebrain bulge laterally to
    form the optic vesicles, which eventually contact the surface ectoderm
    cells.
</p>
<p>
    3. After they make contact, the optic vesicles and the prospective lens
    ectoderm cells secretes an extracellular matrix that causes these cell
    layers to adhere tightly to each other
</p>
<p>
    4. The prospective lens cells elongate to form the thickened lens placode.
</p>
<p>
    5. The lens placode and the outer surface of the optic vesicle invaginate
    to form the lens pit or pore and optic cup respectively.
</p>
<p>
    6. The invaginated lens placode soon separate from the surface ectoderm by
    a process involving the death of the cells in the connecting stalk between
    the cells of the surface ectoderm and the lens placode.
</p>
<p>
    7. During invagination, the optic vesicle and lens separates because
    extracellular matrix between them diminishes.
</p>
<p>
    8. The epithelial cells that gives rise to the lens vesicle lie on a thin
    basal membrane. During invagination, this thin lamina comes to surround the
    lens vesicle. It gradually thickens by the deposition of the successive
    layers of basal lamina material to form the lens capsule.
</p>
<p>
    9. The cells in the posterior end elongates and soon obliterate the lumen
    of the vesicle. These cells are then known as primary fiber cells.
</p>
<p>
    10. Primary fiber cells formation establishes the fundamental structure of
    the lens with epithelial cells covering the anterior surface and elongate
    fiber cells filling the bulk of the lens.

    FIG. P
</p>
<p>
    The lens consists mainly of:
</p>
<p>
    A. Lens capsule
</p>
<p>
    B. Lens epithelium
</p>
<p>
    C. Lens fibers. (Refer to FIG P)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Lens capsule</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The lens capsule is an elastic transparent envelope that surrounds the
    entire lens .Although the lens is elastic in nature in nature but it has no
    elastic fibers. It is highly elastic because of the lamella arrangement of
    the fibers. It elastic nature causes its shape to be altered by the pull
    the zonules or suspensory ligaments.
</p>
<p>
    It thickness varies with location, being thinnest at the poles and equator.
    It thickest in an annular area around the anterior pole. The capsule is
    actually a basement membrane of the lens epithelium.
</p>
<p>
    The capsule consist primarily of collagen. . Specifically the type IV
    collagen. Other components of the capsule includes, laminin, entadin
    (nidogen), and heparin sulfate proteoglycan
</p>
<p>
    The outer superficial zone of the capsule is called the zonular lamella.
    The anterior lens capsule
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Function of the capsule</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Encloses all lens components
</p>
<p>
    2. Helps to mold the shape of the lens.
</p>
<p>
    3. Provides some barrier functions, preventing large molecules such as
    albumin and hemoglobin from entering the lens.
</p>
<p>
    <u>LENS EPITHELIUM</u>
</p>
<p>
    Lens epithelium, located in the anterior portion of the lens between the
    capsule and the lens fibers is a simple cuboidal epithelium. No posterior
    epithelium is present because it was used during embryonic development to
    form the primary lens fibers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Functions of cells of the lens epithelium.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Secretes the anterior capsule throughout life.
</p>
<p>
    2. Site of metabolic transport mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
    - The lens undergoes glucose metabolism. This serves as the main energy
    source of the lens. Glycolysis about 80% of the lens energy because the
    lens is in an anaerobic environment and since glycosis is an anaerobic
    glucose metabolism method.
</p>
<p>
    - Progenitors for new fibers
</p>
<p>
    The basal aspect of the lens epithelium is adjacent to the capsule and the
    apical portion is oriented inward toward the center of the lens.
</p>
<p>
    The lateral membrane of the epithelial cells are joined by desmosomes and
    gab junctions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>LENS FIBER</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Cells near the equatorial margin of the lens epithelium in the region
    called the germinative zone, proliferate slowly. Most of the cells produced
    by mitosis in this region migrate towards the posterior of the lens and
    differentiate into fiber cells at the lens equator.
</p>
<p>
    These new fiber cells elongates and accumulate large amount of crystallins.
    During elongation, the posterior (basal) end of the fiber cells move along
    the inner surface of the capsule and their anterior (apical) ends slide
    beneath the epithelium until they meet the elongating cells from the other
    side of the lens near the posterior and anterior midlines.
</p>
<p>
    The junction between the ends of the cells from the opposite sides of the
    lens are called <strong>sutures</strong>. Once fiber cells reach the
    sutures, they stop elongating and their basal end detaches from the
    capsule.
</p>
<p>
    Soon after reaching the sutures, the fiber cells degrade all intracellular
    membrane-bound organelles including their nuclei, mitochondria and
    endoplasmic reticulum.
</p>
<p>
    <img width="300" height="210"

</p>
<p>
    The lens fibers form the bulk of the lens. They are long, thin,
    transparent, firmly packed with diameter typically between 4-7micrometers
    and length up to 12mm long. They stretch lengthwise from the posterior to
    the anterior poles.
</p>
<p>
    When cut horizontally, they arranged in concentric layers rather like layer
    of an onion. If cut along the equator, it appears as a honeycomb.
</p>
<p>
    The lens fibers are linked via gab junctions and interdigitations of the
    cells that resemble, “ball and socket” joints.
</p>
<p>
    The lens is split into regions depending on the age of the lens fiber of a
    particular layer. Moving outward from the central, oldest layer, the lens
    is split into:
</p>
<p>
    1. An embryonic nucleus
</p>
<p>
    2. The fetal nucleus
</p>
<p>
    3. The adult nucleus
</p>
<p>
    4. And the outer cortex.
</p>
<p>
    New lens fibers generated from lens epithelium, are added to the outer
    cortex.

        <strong>Cataracts</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Cataracts are opacities of the lens. While some are small and do not
    require any treatment, others may be large enough to block light and
    obstruct vision. Cataracts usually develop as the aging lens becomes more
    and more opaque, but cataracts can also form congenitally or after injury
    to the lens. Nuclear sclerosis is a type of age-related cataract. Diabetes
    is another risk factor for cataract. Cataract surgery involves the removal
    of the lens and insertion of an artificial intraocular lens.
