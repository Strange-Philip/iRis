    AN OVERVIEW
</p>
<p>
    The aqueous humor is a transparent clear liquid that fills the Anterior
    chamber and Posterior chamber of the eye. It’s volume is about 250 µL and
    its rate of production, subject to diurnal variation, is about 2.5
    µL/min.The aqueous humor has a specific gravity of 1.003 gm,viscosity near
    to water 1.025,pH of 7.2 ( less than plasma),a refractive index of 1.33
    near that of the cornea and an osmotic pressure 3 – 5 mmol/L greater than
    that of plasma .The aqueous humor is said to be a sterile fluid which is
    produced by the epithelium of the pars plicata of the ciliary body and is
    chiefly secreted by fenestrated capillaries of the ciliary processes into
    the posterior chamber.

<p>
    PRODUCTION OF AQUEOUS HUMOR
</p>
<p>
    The aqueous humor is produced in the pars plicata of the ciliary body and
    is secreted into the posterior chamber through the epithelium covering the
    ciliary processes. It passes between the iris and lens, entering the
    anterior chamber through the pupil.These ciliary processes are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Ciliary Epithelium:</em>
        Consisting of epithelial cells.The ciliary epithelium is grouped into;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ø non-pigmented ciliary epithelium
</p>
<p>
    Ø pigmented ciliary epithelium
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Ciliary body stroma</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ø a loose, vascularized connective tissue fills core of ciliary processes
    extends into , ciliary muscle fibers.
</p>
<p>
    Ø The Connective tissue spaces in the muscle are the pathway for
    uveoscleral outflow.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Ciliary body microvasculature</em>
        :
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ø the ciliary processes have a dual vascular supply. Anterior arteriole-,
    large leaky capillaries

<p>
    FORMATION OF AQUEOUS HUMOR
</p>
<p>
    Three known processes are involved in the formation of aqueous humor;
</p>
<p>
    • Diffusion and ultrafiltration:(10-20% of AH is formed in these
    processes),it involves;
</p>
<p>
    Ø loading of ion and/or solute from the ciliary stroma (blood) into the PE
    cells across its basolateral border
</p>
<p>
    Ø translocation of ion and/or solute through the gap junctions into the NPE
    cells
</p>
<p>
    • Active secretion (80-90% of AH is formed in this process),it involes;
</p>
<p>
    Ø exclusion of ion and/or solute from the NPE cells to the posterior
    chamber driven by an electrochemical gradient and/or by active transport.
</p>
<p>
    Fig 2 shows the Aqueous humor formation processes
</p>

</p>
<p>
    THE FORMATION PROCESSES IN RELATION TO PREESURE
</p>
<p>
    • The hydrostatic pressure at the NPE and Posterior chamber do not favour
    ultrafiltration it rather favours resorption of AH
</p>
<p>
    • Ultrafiltration is pressure sensitive :
</p>
<p>
    Ø Increasing IOP results in decreased ultrafiltration,decreasing IOP
    results in an increased ultrafiltration
</p>
<p>
    v This is measurable and termed as facility of inflow or pseudofacility
</p>
<p>
    • Active secretion is insensitive to pressure
</p>
<p>
    Ø Aqueous secretion does not change with change in IOP
</p>
<p>
    Ø When a person is hanged upside down the IOP increases but aqueous
    secretion remains same
</p>
<p>
    Ø Aqueous production can only be affected when the ciliary processes are
    inflamed
</p>
<p>
    MECHANISMS WHICH FACILITATE THE FLOW OF AQUEOUS HUMOR
</p>
<p>
    • Components of aqueous and production is similar to cerebrospinal fluild
</p>
<p>
    • Aqueous flow is governed by
</p>
<p>
    Ø Hydrostatic phenomenon
</p>
<p>
    Ø Mechanical forces (eye ball, head movements )
</p>
<p>
    Ø Thermal currents (temperature difference between warm vascular iris and
    cold avascular cornea)
</p>
<p>
    Ø Pressure gradient between posterior chamber , anterior chamber and
    episcleral veins
</p>
<p>
    • The entire volume of aqueous is replaced every 90-100mins
</p>
<p>
    Blood Aqueous Barrier
</p>
<p>
    • It is formed of tight junctions between ciliary epithelial cells &amp;
    their
    <br />
    blood membrane.
</p>
<p>
    • It hinders the passage of large molecules e.g. mannitol.
</p>
<p>
    • There’s slow passage of medium sized &amp; water soluble substances.
</p>
<p>
    • It passes lipid soluble substances.
</p>
<p>
    • Clinical application :
</p>
<p>
    Ø use of hyperosmotic agents ( mannitol ) to dehydrate the eye
    <br />
    ( vitreous ).
</p>
<p>
    v rate of penetration of lipid soluble chloramphenicole is greater than
    gentamicin or penicillin in the undisturbed aqueous.
</p>
<p>
    • Factors interrupting Blood aqueous barrier :
</p>
<p>
    Ø Traumatic :
</p>
<p>
    v mechanical :-corneal abrasions, blunt trauma, paracentesis, intra ocular
    surgery &amp; stroking iris.
</p>
<p>
    v physical :- X-ray &amp; atomic radiation.
</p>
<p>
    v chemical :- alkali &amp; irritants.
</p>
<p>
    Ø Physio-pathological :
</p>
<p>
    v VD : histamine, PG &amp; sympathectomy.
</p>
<p>
    v anterior segment inflammation or ischaemia
</p>
<p>
    Ø Pharmacologic :
</p>
<p>
    v cholinergic drugs.
</p>
<p>
    v cholinesterase inhibitors.
</p>
<p>
    v plasma hyperosmolarity.
</p>
<p>
    • When the blood aqueous barrier breakdown, it may lead to uveities
    (inflammation of the uvea; choroid, ciliary body and iris)
</p>
<p>
    AQUEOUS DRAINAGE
</p>
<p>
    • This includes;
</p>
<p>
    Ø Aqueous humor formation
</p>
<p>
    Ø Aqueous humor drainage
</p>
<p>
    • Aqueous humor is produced in the posterior chamber which then flows into
    the anterior chamber through the pupil (conventional currents).
</p>
<p>
    • Aqueous humour is drained from the eye by two avenues;
</p>
<p>
    Trabecular pathway: With this pathway,a relatively large amount of 75 to
    90% aqueous humor flows through.The aqueous humor is said to follow the <em>conventional outflow </em>pathway and
    moves through the meshwork and
    into the narrower pores of the corneoscleral meshwork and through the
    juxtacanalicular tissue(which offer some resistance to the flow) and the
    endothelial lining into Schlemm’s canal which contains internal collector
    channels (of
    <br />
    Sondermann). The aqueous humor then continues to flow through the
    endothelial cells lining the external wall of Schlemm’s canal which are
    joined by <em>zonula occludens </em>and contain
    <br />
    no vacuoles but approximately contain 25 to 35 external collector
    <br />
    channels which are distributed around the outer wall of Schlemm’s canal.The
    aqueous humor then flow from the channel to empty into either the deep
    scleral plexus or the intrascleral plexus of
    <br />
    veins, which in turn drain into the episcleral and
    <br />
    conjunctival veins.

</p>
<p>
    • Uveoscleral pathway: this pathway is called the <em>unconventional outflow </em>and accounts for a relatively
    small amount
    of about 10 to 25% and 0.3μl/min aqueous humor drainage. This pathway is
    independent of IOP,where the posterior chamber increase uveoscleral flow to
    lower the IOP. The aqueous humor passes into the connective tissue spaces
    surrounding the ciliary muscle bundles(ciliary body), moves into the
    suprachoroidal space, and is absorbed into and through the sclera which can
    alternatively be absorbed into the anterior ciliary veins and vortex veins.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    AGING AND RATE OF AQUEOUS FLOW
</p>
<p>
    With age, the anterior chamber angle width narrows and the anterior chamber
    volume decreases, probably secondary to lens growth. This narrowing is more
    significant in women and may be related to the higher incidence of
    angle-closure glaucoma in elderly women.This then results in;
</p>
<p>
    • decrease in aqueous production
</p>
<p>
    Ø a reduction in uveoscleral outflow
    <br />
    reduction
</p>
<p>
    Ø a decrease in the density and size of giant vacuoles
</p>
<p>
    Ø an accumulation of extracellular matrix plaques
    <br />
    in the juxtacanalicular tissue,
</p>
<p>
    v and an increase in the outflow resistance in the vicinity of the
    juxtacanalicular tissue and the inner wall of Schlemm’s canal.
</p>
<p>
    • An increase in the amount of connective tissue in the ciliary muscle
    which may be the cause of;
</p>
<p>
    Ø the reduction in uveoscleral outflow.
</p>
<p>
    • Aqueous flow reduces by 0.0015-0.003𝞵L/min/year : 2-3.5% per year
</p>
<p>
    Ø After 60 years it accelerates to 1 to 2% every year
</p>
<p>
    • However, no age-related increase in IOP is seen in healthy individuals
    with pressures below 22 mm Hg.
