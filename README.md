#### Framework
Iris App is built with the **Flutter SDK** in the **Dart** programming language. This allows Iris App to be deployed on multiple platforms with the same codebase and minimal platform setup.

#### Backend
The app is powered by Sqflite and everything is stored locally.

#### Illustrations

Most of the illustrations are from a website i discovered (https://undraw.co/) .

#### UI/UX

Took some inspiration from pinterest but basically built out the ui all by myself ðŸ˜Œ .

##### P.S.
Feel free to clone and mess around. Pull requests are welcome. There's a lot of data from the backend that isn't being used as per the requirements of the challenge but they can make the app's UI richer.Plus its pretty old code so it may mess up a bit ðŸ˜…
